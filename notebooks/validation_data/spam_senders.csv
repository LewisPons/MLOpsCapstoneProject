The biennial regulatory review provisions of the=20Communications Act of 1934 require the agency in even-numbered years to=20decide whether given rules remain in the public interest, the FCC said. =20The FCC doesn=0F't have to take final action repealing or modifying the rul=es in=20the even-numbered years, it said.The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revis=ed=20version of the September 2000 staff report on the biennial regulatory revie=w=20(TR, Sept. 25, 2000).

It stopped short, however, of adopting any criter=ia=20in binding rules or procedures.The FCC rejected a proposal the U.S. Telecom Association had offered in=20comments on the September staff report (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).  USTA had asked==20the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified a=s=20unnecessary during biennial reviews.Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain==20flexibility, the FCC directed all bureaus and offices =0F""to prioritize=20rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of==20various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of=20comments received=0F"" in response to the planned rulemaking notices.Issuing a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W.

Proponents of the==20technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications, including law==20enforcement, fire and rescue services, the military, medicine, education, a=nd=20home and office local area networks (TR, Sept 18, 2000).  They say it won==0F't=20interfere with existing systems.But aviation groups, the GPS and satellite industries, and others have=20expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems. ==20They=0F've asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show t=hey=20won=0F't cause such interference.In its tests, NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices =on=20federal air-route surveillance radar, airport surveillance radar, and air==20traffic control beacon systems.Based on the results of those tests, NTIA engineers developed mathematical==20models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems, includin=g=20those operating between 3100 and 5650 megahertz, or 3.1 and 5.65 GHz.  The==20tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range, although limits=20might need to be placed on power levels, distance, and pulse-repetition=20frequency.  However, there=0F's a question about whether UWB devices would =have=20a =0F""big enough window=0F"" to operate if restrictions are imposed, Mr. Roh=de said.Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users (3.7=0F-4.2 GHz), micr=owave=20landing services (5.03=0F-5.091 GHz), and Doppler weather radar (5.6=0F-5.6=5 GHz). =20For FSS systems, =0F""the worst-case situation=0F"" with regard to interferen=ce =0F""would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna=20elevation angle of 5 degrees,=0F""  NTIA=0F's report said.

Among the issues to be decided are==20the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and==20which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement.NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said the rules could bolster a high-lev=el=20effort to identify and allocate spectrum for third-generation (3G) wireless==20services.  Then-President Clinton launched the initiative by executive=20memorandum in October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan=.=208).As part of that effort, NTIA is studying the possible use of the 1755=0F-18=50=20megahertz band, which is used heavily by the Defense Department.  The FCC i=s=20analyzing use of the 2500=0F-2690 MHz band, which is used mostly by multich=annel=20multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service==20operators.NTIA=0F's proposed rules would cover such future reallocations, Mr. Rohde s=aid=20at an industry-government meeting on the 3G plan last week.  He said he hop=ed=20the final rules would be released this summer.The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 required privat=e=20entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or==20modifying their systems because of reallocation.  The notice of proposed=20rulemaking NTIA released Jan. 17 suggests ways to implement that mandate. ==20Comments are due March 19 with replies due April 18 in docket no.=20001206341-0341-01.In its rulemaking notice, NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government==20spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technicall=y=20possible in their present bands.If the incumbents are not required to relocate, under what conditions shoul=d=20they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for an=y=20system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing? NTIA asks.  For==20example, it asks, should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the ba=nd=20on a noninterference basis with 3G systems?NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a =0F=""comparable facility=0F"" is available for a reasonable period of time.  It==20defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operationa=l=20capabilities as the original spectrum.  NTIA suggests using four factors to==20determine comparability:  (1) communications throughput, (2) system=20reliability, (3) operating costs, and (4) operational capability.  It seeks==20comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient.NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement. ==20It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs,=20including a mandatory negotiation period, third-party mediation, and=20nonbinding arbitration.NTIA seeks comments on what type of cost-sharing plan to adopt and asks=20whether a =0F""band manager=0F"" or some other entity should serve as a clear=inghouse=20to administer the plan.  And it wants input on whether it should =0F""sunset==0F"" a=20cost-sharing plan five years after any auction of former government=20spectrum.  The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectru=m=20with classified frequency assignments.At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the==20Balanced Budget Act of 1997, NTIA identified 255 MHz of spectrum that can b=e=20reallocated from federal government to private use.  The bands identified f=or=20which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are 216=0F-220 MHz=,=201432=0F-1435 MHz, 1710=0F-1755 MHz, and 2385=0F-2390 MHz.The FCC has proposed allocating the 1710=0F-1755 MHz band for 3G services. = In=20addition, Mr. Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the 1755=0F=-1850=20MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the 3G initiative.Rohde Uncertain of Effort=0F's FutureAt last week=0F's 3G meeting, Mr. Rohde said he didn=0F't know if the Bush==20administration would make any changes to the 3G effort, which is operating =on=20a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for 3G spectrum b=y=20Sept. 30, 2002.  But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings==20with Bush transition team staff members.  =0F""I can=0F't predict what=0F's =going to=20happen=0F"" beyond Inauguration Day, Mr. Rohde told reporters.The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA, James Derderian=,=20a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee, couldn==0F't=20be reached for comment.  But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce=20secretary earlier this month, Donald L. Evans said the Bush administration==20was committed to finding 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).Industry Expresses FrustrationAt last week=0F's meeting, several industry representatives expressed=20frustration that they didn=0F't have access to data they said they needed t=o=20make recommendations on use of the 1755=0F-1850 MHz and 2500=0F-2690 MHz ba=nds in=20time for NTIA and the FCC to consider.  Industry representatives in=20NTIA-established working groups are reviewing the bands.The 3G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released i=n=20March, with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in Ju=ly.Rick Kemper, director-wireless technology and security for the Cellular=20Telecommunications & Internet Association, said determining the cost of=20relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible==20requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how==20they are being used.  But he said that data wasn=0F't available.Donald Brittingham, director-wireless policy for Verizon Wireless, said he==20was concerned that the final band studies wouldn=0F't reflect all the indus=try=0F's=20input.  He urged the regulators to delay releasing the reports.=0F""One concern is we=0F're going to do a lot of work and in the end it wil=l be too=20late to be included in your final report,=0F"" added Joanne C.

AT&T was=20challenging the PSC=0F's 1997 arbitration decision regarding its interconne=ction=20agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.Section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed state commission=s=20to review, approve, and, when necessary, arbitrate carrier interconnection==20agreements.  The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission==20determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropria=te=20federal district court to the review the carrier agreement.In AT&T Communications v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., et al. (case==20no. 99-30421), the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the U.S. District Cou=rt=20in Baton Rouge.  The lower court had held that the 11th Amendment to the U.=S.=20Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees. ==20(AT&T had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit).The 11th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts=. =20But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the U.S.==20Supreme Court in its 1908 decision in Ex parte Young.  The Ex parte Young==20doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoin=g=20violations of federal law.The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their==20constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the=20interconnection dispute under the provisions of the 1996 Act.  The court al=so=20ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to AT&T=0F's request for=20prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that AT&T had=20argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections 251 and 252==20of the Act.The appeals court reversed the district court=0F's ruling and remanded the =case=20for further proceedings.  Circuit Judge James L. Dennis wrote the opinion a=nd=20was joined by Judge Henry A. Politz.  Judge Jerry E. Smith dissented from t=he=20majority=0F's opinion.Finding Echoes Other CircuitsAppeals courts in the Sixth, Seventh, and 10th Circuits already have held==20that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to=20state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection agreements (TR=,=20April 5 and Oct. 25, 1999; and Jan. 24, June 26, and July 31, 2000).  Last==20fall, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the issue in a case arising =in=20the Sixth Circuit (TR, Oct. 9, 2000).In his dissent, Judge Smith cited the U.S. Supreme Court=0F's 1996 decision= in=20Seminole Tribe v.

Under that ruling, he said, Congress=0F' referr=al of=20disputes surrounding state commission=0F-arbitrated interconnection agreeme=nts =0F""supplants=0F"" a party=0F's ability to sue the state commission under the 19=08=20Supreme Court decision in Ex parte Young.  But, he added, Congress=0F' refe=rral=20of such disputes to the federal courts violates the 11th Amendment to the==20Constitution.The Chicago-based Seventh Circuit rejected a similar argument last year in==20which state utility commissioners had invoked Seminole Tribe (TR, July 31,==202000).AeA Seeking Federal Preemption Of Multiple State Privacy LawsLawmakers in the 107th Congress should make federal preemption of multiple==20state privacy laws =0F""one of the top legislative concerns=0F"" for the comi=ng=20session, according to AeA, formerly the American Electronics Association. ==20Federal privacy legislation =0F""should play a crucial role=0F"" in maintaini=ng=20consistency and certainty=0F"" in the marketplace, said William T.

That=0F's the message the National Telephone Cooperative Associa=tion=20is carrying to the FCC and Congress as it seeks to garner more federal=20support for some of its pet projects.On Capitol Hill, NTCA plans to revive its legislative push to eliminate cap=s=20on the amount that individual carriers are eligible to receive in universal==20service support, says Chief Executive Officer Michael Brunner.  The=20association is considering broadening that proposal to include a broadband==20tax credit plan, he says.At the FCC, the group=0F's most pressing concern is getting quick adoption =of=20the multiassociation group (MAG) plan for overhauling the interstate access==20charge system for telcos operating under rate-of-return regulation, Mr.=20Brunner tells TR.  An edited transcript of our conversation follows.TR:  What are NTCA=0F's top priorities for the 107th Congress?  Should we e=xpect=20to see your proposal from the last Congress to lift the universal service c=ap?Brunner:  The answer is yes.  As you know, we were instrumental in working==20with [Sen. Conrad] Burns [R., Mont.] in getting that bill introduced in the==20last session.  Obviously that=0F's a priority again, as the Rural Task Forc=e has=20sort of come up with half a loaf in recommending an index cap.We see the Rural Task Force plan as better obviously than the current=20situation, but we see it causing a problem down the road.  For example, if =a=20lot of acquisitions occur=0F-and I think they will=0F-then there=0F's going= to be a=20need to upgrade all those lines. =20The current cap won=0F't be adequate to do that, and we hope the Commission=,=20under any circumstances, wouldn=0F't go below what the Rural Task Force is==20recommending.TR:  That effort garnered bipartisan backing from key U.S. senators last=20session.  What=0F's your strategy for expanding congressional support for i=t in=20the 107th Congress?Brunner:  One way to do that might be to go back to the drafting of the=20Telecommunications Act of 1996, when Congress really understood that we hav=e=20to give equal weight to the twin goals of competition and universal service=. =20Our feeling is that this Commission and the past Commissions, perhaps, may==20have given more weight to competition and less to universal service.It=0F's real clear in the statute that Congress thinks those issues are equ=ally=20weighted, and whether or not people like it, things cost more in rural=20America.  If we really want to bring broadband services to all Americans, w=e=20can=0F't do it without some kind of support. =20And if Congress is saying on the one hand, =0F""Deploy advanced services,=0F="" it=20seems odd to say on the other hand, =0F""We=0F're going to limit this cap, l=imit the=20support.=0F""Rep. Nathan Deal [R., Ga.] was our key guy in the House on this last year,==20and Sen. Burns in the Senate.  We=0F're working with a lot of other people,= too,=20to see if we can=0F't be more comprehensive this time around.For example, another key component of our plan could be some kind of tax=20credit or a low-interest [Rural Utilities Service] loan.  And rather than==20have one bill address this part and one for that part, we may have all of==20those wind up in one comprehensive package.On the broadband tax credit plan, the idea is to develop. . .a bill that=20would enable carriers to claim a fairly substantial credit for deploying=20broadband services to rural areas.  We don=0F't want it to be technology-==20specific, where you end up with something that seems to favor one technolog=y=20over the other.I don=0F't want to be too specific because we=0F're still working with a nu=mber of=20our own members to work out the details.  We don=0F't have a perfect packag=e=20yet. . .and I don=0F't think it would be hugely expensive.  We realize no o=ne=0F's=20going to go for a big spending bill, especially with the economy sort of=20turning right now, or potentially turning.But we=0F're still moving forward on this.  Our annual meeting will be held= the=20first week in February, and that=0F's when we=0F're really going to start h=ashing=20out some of these things and talking about some overall policy resolutions.TR:  One thing you haven=0F't mentioned is a deregulatory approach to broad=band=20service deployment.  Why?Brunner:  We really haven=0F't been drawn to that approach for a lot of rea=sons,=20one being that we think a broadband tax credit bill is a more targeted=20approach that really gets at the issue.  If the policy-makers really want t=o=20deploy broadband services nationwide, and they say they do, this is the way==20to help us to do it.TR:  Staying on the congressional front, what=0F's NTCA=0F's reaction to Fr=ed Upton=20[R., Mich.], who has limited telecom experience, being named chairman of th=e=20House Energy and Commerce Committee=0F's telecommunications subcommittee?Brunner:  We=0F're excited about Fred Upton being in that role.  He does ha=ve=20some rural parts to his district; in fact, some of our own commercial telco==20members are up there=0F-Bloomingdale Telephone Co. of Bloomingdale, Mich., =and=20Climax Telephone Co., of Climax, Mich.Also, the ratio now in the House is about 14 urban members to one rural=20member.  So whenever you get a person with some rural territory in a key=20telecom policy-making slot, NTCA is thrilled.  We think that Mr. Upton will==20do a good job and hope he=0F'll be sensitive to NTCA=0F's issues.TR:  I understand that you=0F've been consulting with members of Congress a=bout=20the MAG plan and that some senators have asked the FCC to put it on the fro=nt=20burner.  What kind of time line do you have in mind for action on the MAG==20plan?Brunner:  We want to move it quickly.  We=0F've spent a lot of time, as hav=e=20other trade associations, getting our members on board.  It was a grueling==20process, and I think the product=0F's pretty good.  So our feeling, at this==20point, is that we really want the whole thing adopted as is.We=0F're not comfortable backing off any part of it.  If the Commission doe=s=20back off or review it, then we reserve the right to say, =0F""Stop, and let==0F's=20look at it again.=0F""The main thing is keeping the process moving.  It=0F's easy for things to g=et=20bogged down in the regulatory or congressional processes.  We have many=20friends on Capitol Hill, mainly in the Senate, where so many members have k=ey=20rural areas in their state.  The main message right now is, =0F""Let=0F's ke=ep the=20MAG plan moving.=0F""Most people think it=0F'll probably take six months to a year to get the wh=ole=20thing through.  The other wild card, to some extent, is the Rural Task Forc=e=20report, which is moving along on a fast track.  There=0F's some commonality==20between those two.  Our dream=0F-although we thought it probably wasn=0F't =super=20likely=0F-was that the Commission would just simply adopt the MAG plan as i=s.TR:  What about the expected turnover at the FCC?  How do you see that=20affecting the Com-mission=0F's consideration of the MAG plan?Brunner:  It could go a bunch of different ways.  You could get someone=20coming in who says, =0F""A lot of real smart people spent a lot of time on t=his,=20and rather than reinvent the wheel, I=0F'm more inclined to support it.=0F""Or you could get someone else who says, =0F""I don=0F't understand all this,= and I=20want to start from square one and take my time.=0F""  We just don=0F't know =who the=20players are going to be.  I expect some of the current Commissioners still==20will be there.TR:  Most believe Commissioner Michael K. Powell will be tapped to fill the==20vacant chairman seat, at least initially.  Have you gotten any feedback fro=m=20his office about his position on the MAG plan?Brunner:  Not really.  We=0F've visited the staffs of all the Commissioners=, and=20most of them weren=0F't real specific on [the plan].  So we certainly want =to=20give him and others the benefit of the doubt.  We hope they would view it==20favorably.  I think everyone will respect the work that went into it, even =if=20they don=0F't agree with it.TR:  Let=0F's talk about your recent white paper recommending that universa=l=20service =0F""high-cost=0F"" support be =0F""nonportable=0F"" [TR, Jan. 15].  Ho=w did you come=20to this conclusion, and where do you go with it?Brunner:  What we=0F've got there is a study with some actual data.  It sho=ws=20that introducing competition in rural areas is ultimately going to lead to==20less broadband technology deployment. =20Our next step is to try to convince regulators that artificial competition==20doesn=0F't work.  If there=0F's an actual market for more than one carrier,= then=20indeed consumers might benefit.  But there aren=0F't great public benefits,= as=20we see it, to artificially creating competition where markets don=0F't=20ordinarily permit competition as a matter of course.Our point is that sometimes the regulators try to take an urban solution an=d=20inject it into rural America.  It makes sense to induce competition in=20downtown areas like Los Angeles or Chicago, where the average Bell company==20has anywhere from 130 to 150 customers per mile.  But we only have four or==20five or six per mile=0F-very small numbers.We would argue that it=0F's hard for one carrier to really make it in these==20markets.  And if they force a second one or a third one in, it splits up th=e=20business even more, and no one=0F's going to have the wherewithal to delive=r=20broadband services.One of our main themes on Capitol Hill and at the Commission is that=20policy-makers need to appreciate the fact that rural areas are different. ==20Most policy-makers, as you might imagine, have an urban background. . .Our==20job is to continue to try to educate people about the differences between==20urban and rural areas.We=0F've done that with some success.  For example, we=0F've had several of= the=20Commissioners come out and speak at our meetings, spend time with our=20members, talk with them one-on-one.  [Commissioner Harold W.]=20Furchtgott-Roth, for example, came out and visited a small telco with us.  =We=20really look for opportunities to give them a greater appreciation of these==20kinds of things.Going back to Congress, we also want to really caution people not to reopen==20up the Telecommunications Act or to pass a new Act until some of the key=20rural issues are resolved.  We=0F're now going on five years since passage =of=20the Telecommunications Act, and some of our members still can=0F't plan bec=ause=20they don=0F't know about [the outcome of] access charge reform.  As you kno=w,=20our members get better than 50% of their revenues from access charges.The biggest decisions for the new Commission will be on high-cost support a=nd=20access charge reform.  Both the MAG and the Rural Task Force plans have=20touched on that.TR:  Switching gears to the incoming Bush administration, how do you forese=e=20the Department of Agriculture=0F's Rural Utilities Service [RUS] developing= over=20the next few years?  Will there be major changes?Brunner:  Actually, to be honest, no one knows.  My sense is that the RUS n=o=20longer is the political issue it used to be because when people look at it,==20they=0F're seeing that the cost of that program is so minute.  It=0F's some=where=20around $6 million or $7 million in interest subsidies for about $600 millio=n=20in loans.And everyone thinks it does work well; there=0F's never been a default.  So= I=20don=0F't sense we=0F're going to have an effort, as was made in the Reagan==20administration, to really cut back on some of these things.  I could be=20totally wrong, but my sense is it has enough respect and support on both=20sides of the aisle.Plus, the lending no longer is simply for the same =0F""plain old telephone==20service=0F""; it=0F's now for some new things.TR:  Let=0F's talk about NTCA=0F's membership.  What kind of efforts are un=der way=20to accommodate some of your members=0F' non-ILEC [incumbent local exchange==20carrier] operations?Brunner:  Many years ago there were questions about how our members would==20adapt to change in competition.  My sense is that they=0F're adapting quite==20well, as almost all of them are in multiple lines of business.  They=0F're==20becoming Internet service providers, many of them are in the cable TV=20business, most of them have wireless or broadcast satellite operations, som=e=20are resellers, and many are becoming CLECs [competitive local exchange=20carriers].They=0F've gotten into multiple lines of business, so they are becoming, in= a=20lot of ways, more than ILECs.  We=0F've broadened our approach to assist th=em in=20some other areas.  So it=0F's a very active membership, some more than othe=rs.We have a new initiative called C3A.  It=0F's really an effort to get membe=rs=20who are thinking more competitively to get together and perhaps aggregate==20their businesses with things like volume discounts. =20I=0F've been very pleased with our membership=0F's willingness to grow and =change. =20For a while I thought they just might want to keep doing things the same ol=d=20way that has always worked for them.  But they really are changing.We=0F're not the biggest player.  We=0F're only about 5% of the industry, b=ut it=20really is a critical 5%.  We represent roughly 40% of the land in this=20country, but it=0F's a unique and critical part.We would just really hope that the policy-makers would make it a priority t=o=20understand that the 5% we serve is as important as the whole.  That=0F's=20something that some people miss.Executive BriefingsThe New FCC? =0F- Speculation is rife that a decision on the FCC top spot i=s=20imminent, as FCC transition team advisers meet to discuss potential changes==20at the agency.

The FCC tinkered with its rules governing those==20duties in an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking released in=20Common Carrier dockets 96-98 and 98-147.  The order addressed petitions for==20reconsideration and clarification of a previous order on line sharing (TR,==20Nov. 22, 1999).Line sharing is the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers=20(ILECs) allow competitors to offer high-speed service over the high-frequen=cy=20portion of a loop, while the ILEC continues to offer voice service over the==20low-frequency portion.In the order adopted Jan. 19, the FCC said ILECs must provide line sharing==20over the entire loop even if they=0F've deployed fiber in the loop to suppl=ement=20or replace the original copper line.  The order was one of many actions tha=t=20the FCC took on the last day of Chairman William E.

It=0F's also sparking concern among s=chools=20and libraries that have participated in the program and benefited from it.They=0F're worried that the president=0F's E-rate proposal, if adopted in i=ts=20current =0F""blueprint=0F"" form, would discourage certain schools from apply=ing for=20discounts on telecom and Internet services and internal connections.  In th=e=20long run, they fear that the president=0F's proposal would lead to decrease=d=20funding for the program, which currently stands at $2.25 billion a year.The main problem, these critics say, is that shifting administration of the==20program to the Department of Education, as President Bush has said he inten=ds=20to do, would render E-rate funding dependent on congressional=20appropriations.  In its current form under the FCC=0F's oversight, the prog=ram=20is funded by universal service contributions assessed from telecom carriers=.The technology part of the president=0F's education reform initiative unvei=led=20last week calls for combining the E-rate with several Department of Educati=on=20programs to form one =0F""performance-based technology grant program.=0F""  T=hen, it=20says, funding for that program would be disbursed =0F""by formula=0F"" to sta=tes=20through block grants.The aim is to streamline the many =0F""duplicative technology programs=0F"" i=nto one=20education grant plan, the Bush administration says.

They say more details are needed from the Bush administration on==20several issues, including how the E-rate program would be funded and what==20formula would be used to distribute money among the states.Jeff Burnett, director-government relations at the National Association of==20Independent Schools, says the language of the proposal is cloudy when it=20comes to whether the program would be supported by the Universal Service=20Fund, as it is now, or by general tax revenues.  =0F""That=0F's a huge quest=ion=20mark, and we are highly nervous about it because it does appear that it wou=ld=20become part of the Department of Education=0F's budget,=0F"" he says.Mr. Burnett says making the E-rate dependent on general tax revenues could ==0F""destabilize=0F"" its funding and discourage some private and parochial schoo=ls=20from applying for telecom discounts.  =0F""It would go from where it is now,= a=20pretty stable $2.25 billion per year, to where you would have arguments eve=ry=20year in Congress over how much money it would get.=0F""Plus, he says, E-rate funds =0F""no longer would be string-free=0F"" if they =were to=20be allocated by the federal government.  Moving the program to the Departme=nt=20of Education could discourage religious schools from participating because =of=20potential =0F""church-state problems,=0F"" he says, referring to the First Am=endment=20to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits congressional establishment of an==20official religion.  And some states may be restricted by their state=20constitutions from providing federally funded educational services to priva=te=20and religious schools, he adds.Former FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, who oversaw the implementation of the=20E-rate program back in 1996, fears that the end result could be the =0F""kil=ling=20of the program altogether=0F"" or a =0F""chopping of it down from a significa=nt=20program to an insignificant one.=0F""   =20Having the Education Department oversee the E-rate program would remove=20stability from the program, Mr. Hundt stressed.  =0F""Where are they going t=o=20find 2, 3, or 4 billion dollars in the general [tax revenues] to pay for it=?=0F""=20he asked.  =0F""The bigger [telecom service] providers probably would be hap=py,=20but the [support] would be reduced,=0F"" Mr. Hundt told TR last week.He also rejected the administration=0F's claims that consolidating the educ=ation=20technology programs would reduce applicants=0F' paperwork and filing=20requirements.  =0F""Moving it to the Department of Education is not a way to==20simplify paperwork,=0F"" Mr. Hundt said.  =0F""Nothing is simpler than the wa=y it=0F's=20done now.

Schools and libraries are required to bar access =to=20visual depictions that are =0F""harmful to minors=0F"" only when minors are u=sing the=20computers.The law requires E-rate recipients to certify each program year that they a=re=20complying with the filtering mandate and that they monitor the operation of==20the filtering technology while the computers are in use.  The law allows an==20administrator to disable the filtering technology while the computer is bei=ng=20used by an adult =0F""for bona fide research or other lawful purpose.=0F""Schools and libraries have one year to adopt an Internet safety policy; in==20the first year after the effective date of the law, they either must certif=y=20that they have such a policy or that they are developing one.The law also allows schools and libraries to seek a waiver from the FCC=20during the law=0F's second year, if state or local procurement rules or=20competitive bidding requirements have prevented them from implementing an==20Internet safety policy.The FCC=0F's further notice of proposed rulemaking released last week in Co=mmon=20Carrier docket 96-45 proposes that E-rate recipients this year certify eith=er=20that they have complied with all relevant provisions of the CIPA or that th=e=20CIPA requirements don=0F't apply.  The certifications would appear on their= =0F""receipt of confirmation=0F"" forms (FCC Form 486).The CIPA doesn=0F't require schools and libraries that use E-rate funds onl=y for=20telecom services=0F-and not for Internet access or internal connections=0F-=to=20install the filtering technology.The FCC proposes that in future years recipients include their compliance==20certifications on FCC Form 471, which is used to describe the services to b=e=20funded.  It asks how to implement the =0F""remedial=0F"" provisions of the CI=PA,=20which detail ways an applicant can correct its noncompliance or=20noncertification.  Comments are due 15 days after publication of the=20rulemaking notice in the Federal Register; replies are due 30 days later.The American Library Association has announced plans to challenge the=20constitutionality of the CIPA (TR, Jan. 22), whose Internet-filtering=20requirements extend to other federal programs that subsidize schools=0F' an=d=20libraries=0F' purchases of computers and Internet access.The ALA, which notes that the CIPA takes effect April 20, has launched a We=b=20site where it will post information about its activities regarding the CIPA==20(http://www.ala.org/cipa).Meanwhile, President Bush last week announced a proposal for modifying the==20E-rate program, including reducing the paperwork demands on applicants (see==20separate story).Large Carriers Want 700 MHz Auction Postponed, But Small Providers,=20Broadcasters Oppose DelayLarge wireless carriers are once again asking the FCC to postpone the=20scheduled auction of licenses for the 700 megahertz band, citing a host of==20familiar concerns that they say could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the==20frequencies.But rural carriers and TV broadcasters are urging the Commission to begin t=he=20auction March 6, as scheduled, noting that the sale already has been=20postponed three times.  They say that large carriers have had plenty of tim=e=20to prepare for the auction and that further delays would be unfair to them.They offered their views in comments filed with the FCC last week in respon=se=20to a request by Verizon Wireless to delay the sale until September (TR, Jan=.=2022).  Several large carriers that supported the request asked for an even==20longer postponement.Supporters of postponement cited the presence of broadcasters in the spectr=um=20and the need to negotiate band-clearing agreements as evidence to support==20their cause (see separate story).  Most of their arguments echoed those of==20Verizon Wireless.TV broadcasters don=0F't have to evacuate the spectrum (channels 60=0F-69) =as part=20of the transition to digital TV until 2006 at the earliest.

Wheeler.  A scarcity in=20frequencies is hurting U.S. carriers=0F' competitiveness with their foreign==20counterparts and thwarting development of the wireless Internet, he said.Mr. Wheeler urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier ma=y=20hold in any one market while a high-level effort to identify and allocate==20frequencies for third-generation (3G) services proceeded.  Such a move woul=d=20ease the spectrum crunch, he reasoned.At a briefing for reporters last week, he said the Bush administration had==20its work cut out for it in collaborating with the FCC to find suitable band=s=20for 3G use.U.S. Seen Falling Behind=0F""God bless the Clinton administration for starting the spectrum policy r=eview=20process, but [it] couldn=0F't bring it to fruition, and it now falls to the= Bush=20administration to deal with the really hard parts and to make decisions,=0F="" Mr.=20Wheeler said.=0F""Those decisions will probably take time.

The==20FCC asked for comments on the issue last week (see separate story).He said he had =0F""some very profitable discussions=0F"" with Bush transitio=n team=20officials on spectrum issues, although he wouldn=0F't elaborate.  He also s=aid=20he was pleased that Donald L.

Regarding privacy, he said the==20trade group had gotten a positive response from members of Congress and=20regulators to its proposed principles for location-information services (TR=,=20Oct. 30 and Nov. 27, 2000).Mr. Wheeler defended the industry=0F's claims regarding the safety of mobil=e=20phones.  A new book by George L.

The book is particularly critical of Mr. Wheeler.  The industry==20also has suffered recent setbacks in pending court cases that claim mobile==20phones are dangerous to humans (TR, Jan. 22).=0F""I don=0F't think that the issue is George Carlo or Tom Wheeler or CTIA,==0F"" Mr.=20Wheeler said.  =0F""The whole issue is, What=0F's the science? . . .We=0F've= supported=20independent science and will continue to support independent science.=0F""As for litigation, he said that lawsuits alleging a link between exposure t=o=20radio frequency emissions and health effects such as cancer had been=20dismissed in the past.Nextel Communications, Inc., has agreed to purchase specialized mobile=20radio...Nextel Communications, Inc., has agreed to purchase specialized mobile=20radio(SMR) licenses from Arch Wireless, Inc., for $175 million and invest $=75=20million in the paging carrier.

Nextel said==20the transition would give it about 20 megahertz of SMR spectrum in the 800==20and 900 MHz bands in 52 of the top 100 U.S. markets.Commission Examines Merits Of Lifting CMRS Spectrum CapThe FCC is reexamining whether to lift its cap on the amount of spectrum=20wireless carriers may hold in any one market.  The Commission also is=20considering whether it should eliminate its cellular cross-interest rule.In a notice of proposed rulemaking released last week, the FCC asked for=20comments on whether the spectrum cap should be retained, modified, or=20eliminated to comply with the public-interest standard set forth in section==2011 of the Communications Act, as amended.Specifically, the agency is soliciting views on whether =0F""meaningful econ=omic=20competition=0F"" in the commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) market has=20rendered spectrum aggregation limits, including the cellular cross-interest==20rule, unnecessary.Under the agency=0F's rules, carriers aren=0F't allowed to hold more than 4=5=20megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and 55 MHz in rural markets.  The=20cellular cross-interest rule restricts an entity=0F's ownership interest in==20cellular carriers operating in the same market.  The FCC wants to know=20whether those limits are still needed to prevent harmful concentration of==20spectrum holdings or ensure opportunities for new players to enter the mark=et.The Commission is asking for comments on what constitutes =0F""meaningful=20economic competition=0F"" under section 11 and how competitive conditions ha=ve=20changed since it last reviewed the restrictions in 1999.In the largest metropolitan areas, where seven in 10 Americans live, at lea=st=20five mobile telephone carriers are offering service, the agency noted last==20week.  As a result, it said, prices are declining, coverage areas are=20expanding, and new service packages are being offered.  It wants to know if==20there are public-interest reasons for maintaining the cap regardless of suc=h=20competitive developments.Large wireless carriers have lobbied the FCC to lift the cap, saying it has==20thwarted the U.S. wireless industry=0F's deployment of third-generation (3G=)=20services, placing it at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.  Some=20smaller carriers, however, have asked the FCC to retain the cap, saying it==0F's=20needed to ensure that they remain competitive against their larger=20counterparts.In a broad review of the cap conducted in 1999, the FCC decided to retain t=he=20restriction, although it eased the limit in rural markets (TR, Sept. 20,=201999).  At the time, it concluded that the cap was a safeguard against=20excessive concentration in the CMRS market, preserving competition and the==20consumer benefits it had produced.  It also determined in 1999 that the=20cellular cross-interest restriction was necessary to protect competition. ==20The agency eased the rules somewhat, however, permitting some degree of=20cross-interest.In November 2000, the FCC denied two petitions for reconsideration of its==201999 decision but said it would reexamine the cap as part of its 2000=20biennial review (TR, Nov. 13, 2000).  The notice of proposed rulemaking,=20adopted Jan. 19 and released Jan. 23 in Wireless Telecommunications docket==2001-14, stems from that review.  Comments are due 60 days after the notice==0F's=20publication in the Federal Register, and replies are due 30 days after that=.In a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said that h=e=20supported the rulemaking notice but that he tentatively would have conclude=d=20that the cap should be lifted.=0F""The use of a spectrum cap is a drastic regulatory remedy that continues= to=20search for a corresponding competitive ill,=0F"" he said.  =0F""I have grown==20impatient with the Commission=0F's repeated reexaminations of these issues==20without substantial alterations in our policy approach.=0F""Industry Praises ReviewThomas E. Wheeler, president and chief executive officer of the Cellular=20Telecommunications & Internet Association, said that lifting the cap was=20crucial while a high-level effort to identify and allocate 3G bands winds==20through the regulatory process (see separate story).Mr. Wheeler told reporters at a luncheon last week that such access to=20additional spectrum was necessary for the U.S. to maintain its leadership i=n=20the development of the Internet as it moves to wireless devices.Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencie=s=20for 3G services, setting aside twice as much spectrum as the U.S. has, he==20said.The Personal Communications Industry Association, however, has said the cap==20is necessary to give smaller carriers a chance to enter the CMRS market.Mr. Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell had said =he=20would favor lifting the spectrum cap.  =0F""Clearly in some of the opinions =that=20he=0F's written in the spectrum proceeding, he=0F's asked the question, Why= should=20this continue?=0F"" Mr. Wheeler said.  =0F""We=0F're hopeful.=0F""Then-Commissioner Powell voted to retain the cap in November 2000 but said =he=20tended to agree with Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth=0F's conclusion that the =cap =0F""has outlived its usefulness.=0F""Notice Explores AlternativesIn its rulemaking notice, the FCC seeks comments on alternatives to lifting==20the spectrum cap entirely or leaving it untouched.  For example, it asks=20whether it should apply the cap only to spectrum used for voice services.  =It=20also asks whether it should retain the cap in markets where there is less==20competition and eliminate it in other markets where more carriers are=20offering service.The FCC also solicits opinions on whether to treat already-licensed spectru=m=20differently from frequencies licensed in the future.  =0F""As a general matt=er,=20we believe that newly available CMRS-suitable spectrum either should be=20excluded from the spectrum cap, or, if it is included, that the cap should =be=20adjusted accordingly,=0F"" the Commission said.The FCC also wants opinions on how eliminating or relaxing the cap would=20affect its authority to review license-transfer requests under section 310(=d)=20of the Act.

The FCC previously ruled that requesting carriers can==0F't=20use EELs to provide exchange access services exclusively.The FCC had imposed that prohibition in response to incumbent local exchang=e=20carriers=0F' fears that competitors could use EELS to avoid paying special==20access charges (TR, Sept. 20, 1999).  The Commission later extended the=20prohibition and promised to revisit the issue early this year (TR, June 12,==202000).In a Jan. 24 public notice seeking comments on the issue (Common Carrier=20docket 96-98), the FCC asked if the exchange access and local exchange=20markets were =0F""so interrelated from an economic and technological perspec=tive=20that a finding that a network element meets the =0F`impair=0F' standard und=er=20section 251(d)(2) of the [Telecommunications Act of 1996] for the local=20exchange market would itself entitle competitors to use that network elemen=t=20solely or primarily in the exchange access market.=0F""The =0F""impair=0F"" standard requires the FCC to evaluate whether the failur=e to=20unbundle each network element would impair competitors=0F' ability to provi=de=20service.The FCC asked whether the local exchange and exchange access markets are ==0F""economically and technically distinct.=0F""  If the markets are distinct, do=es=20lack of access to loop-transport combinations impair requesting carriers=0F='=20ability to provide special access services? the FCC asked.It asked about the availability of =0F""alternative elements=0F"" aside from =those=20offered by the incumbents.

One case stems from a challenge of the FCC=0F's==20methodology for setting rates for interconnection and unbundled network=20elements (UNEs).  In a separate case, the court will consider whether the==20agency has authority to regulate the rates utility companies charge wireles=s=20and cable TV service providers for attaching equipment to their utility pol=es.Oral arguments in the cases haven=0F't been scheduled yet.  As she has done= in a=20number of other telecom-related cases, Justice Sandra Day O=0F'Connor recus=ed=20herself from the court=0F's deliberations.In the first case, a federal appeals court had overturned the FCC=0F's use =of=20TELRIC (total-element long-run incremental cost) pricing rules for setting==20rates for interconnection and UNEs (TR, July 24, 2000).The high court said it would focus on the following questions: =20(1)Whether the TELRIC methodology is unlawful under section 252(d)(1) of th=e=20Telecommunications Act of 1996,=20(2)Whether the Act or the =0F""takings clause=0F"" of the Fifth Amendment to =the U.S.=20Constitution requires incorporation of an incumbent local exchange carrier==0F's=20(ILEC=0F's) historical costs in its UNE rates, and=20(3)Whether section 251(c) (3) of the Act prohibits regulators from requirin=g=20that ILECs combine certain previously uncombined network elements at the=20request of a new market entrant.=20The consolidated cases beginning with Verizon Communications, Inc., v. FCC =et=20al.(no. 00-511) came from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit==20(St. Louis).  In what many incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)=20considered a victory, the Eighth Circuit last year overturned the FCC=0F's==20TELRIC pricing rules.  But the court didn=0F't go so far as to agree with I=LECs=20that rates for interconnection and UNEs must be based on historic costs.In the second case, the Supreme Court will consider whether the =0F""pole=20attachment=0F"" provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, ap=ply=20to cable TV facilities that also are used to provide high-speed Internet=20access and to equipment used to provide wireless services.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta) had held that the==20FCC didn=0F't have authority to regulate the rates utilities can charge for==20facilities that Internet or wireless service providers attach to their pole=s=20(TR, April 17, 2000).  The pole attachment provisions apply only to cable T=V=20and wireline telephone services, the appeals court ruled.

The interconnection provisions are included in th=e=20Telecommunications Act of 1996.The 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants states immunity from=20federal lawsuits, but a 1908 Supreme Court decision, Ex parte Young,created==20an exception for lawsuits seeking to prevent an ongoing violation of federa=l=20law by state officials.The high court=0F's action last week left in place a ruling by the U.S. Cou=rt of=20Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago) that the Ex parte Young exception==20applies to lawsuits involving carrier interconnection proceedings.This isn=0F't the first time the Supreme Court has refused to take on such =a=20case.

Determining whether they can pay those and=20future debts is the job of credit-rating agencies like Moody=0F's Investors==20Service.Robert Ray, a senior vice president in the telecom, technology, and media==20group at Moody=0F's, tells TR that some of the biggest names in telecom, li=ke=20AT&T Corp., are in danger of losing top credit ratings and having to pay mo=re=20interest in their next round of funding.  An edited transcript of our=20interview with Mr. Ray follows.TR:  What does Moody=0F's do?  What=0F's your role?Ray:  I=0F'm lead analyst for a number of high-visibility companies in medi=a,=20technology, and telecommunications.  I=0F'm responsible not only for assign=ing=20ratings to companies but also for monitoring those ratings as companies=0F'==20business prospects ebb and flow to make sure that our ratings, once assigne=d,=20continue to be accurate.In case we=0F're no longer comfortable with the rating, it=0F's my responsi=bility=20to make a recommendation to change the rating of a company.TR:  The news about telecom debt levels has been gloomy [see separate=20story].  What=0F's your perspective on the financial health of the telecom==20sector?Ray:  There have been a number of defaults and bankruptcies, particularly==20among the CLECs [competitive local exchange carriers].  There are a number =of=20companies that have tried to enter the market.  Not all the business plans==20were fully funded.As both the equity and the debt markets have become more restricted,=20companies that didn=0F't have a fully funded business plan=0F-that didn=0F'=t have=20enough money on hand or committed money from their bank group to cover thei=r=20cash needs over the next 12 to 18 months=0F-have found themselves in liquid=ity=20crunches relatively quickly.TR:  On the equity side, a lot of analysts were surprised by what happened =in=20the telecom sector.  Is there a similar sense on the credit and debt side==20that investors and their advisers were caught by surprise?Ray:  In the high-yield area many of the companies had relatively low ratin=gs=0F-single-B or Caa.  Those ratings don=0F't necessarily anticipate a certainty= of=20default, but they do reflect a high degree of risk.Even on the investment-grade side, however, we=0F've seen some surprising==20developments=0F-not so much in terms of direction, but in terms of speed=0F=-primarily in the pricing environment for long distance services from=20companies such as AT&T and WorldCom [Inc.] =20We were aware that those prices were going to come under pressure as the Ba=by=20Bells began to get permission to offer long distance service in their home==20markets, as usage moved from wireline to wireless [service], and as usage==20began moving from traditional circuit-switched networks to Internet-deliver=ed=20voice.While we knew there were a lot of pressures that were going to bring pricin=g=20down in that market, the degree of the falloff was a bit of a surprise even==20to us.  As a result, the large long distance carriers have had to scale bac=k=20their expectations for profitability in the voice business.TR:  And as a consequence, their credit ratings have come under downward=20pressure.Ray:  Yes, AT&T has had its long-term rating lowered from A1 to A2, and tha=t=20rating remains on review.  Certainly the pressures from the voice business==20were part of that.  But AT&T is also in the process of breaking itself up==20into three separate businesses.  The review is not only focusing on some of==20the risks that we=0F've talked about, but also the financial structure that= each=20of these businesses will have going forward.We=0F've changed the outlook on Sprint [Corp.] from stable to negative. =20WorldCom retains an A3 rating and a stable outlook.  While they=0F've had s=ome=20pressure like the other players, they had a little more flexibility, under==20the current rating, to absorb some of those pressures.TR:  How big a deal is it to these companies to have their credit rating go==20down a step?  What effect does that have on their day-to-day business?Ray:  On the day-to-day business it has relatively limited impact.  To the==20extent that they would be issuing new debt, a lower credit rating normally==20would result in a higher interest rate.The most critical rating for AT&T is its short-term rating of Prime-1.  If==20they didn=0F't have a Prime-1 rating, they=0F'd be severely limited in thei=r=20ability to sell commercial paper to the money market funds.  [Securities an=d=20Exchange Commission rules limit the amount money market funds can invest in==20companies that don=0F't have top-tier commercial paper ratings, like Prime-=1,=20from at least two rating agencies.  =0F-Ed.]For a company whose commercial paper outstanding has been between $15 billi=on=20and $20 billion, that could result in a significant increase in AT&T=0F's==20funding costs.  They would have to seek out, for the most part, a different==20group of investors.TR:  Is AT&T=0F's Prime-1 rating under review?Ray:  Yes, it is.  Both the A2 long-term rating and our Prime-1 short-term==20rating are on review for possible downgrade.TR:  Can you give me an example of what the cost of money might be to AT&T==20through a money market fund v. the next-best alternative?Ray:  The money market funds would just be one of a number of investors who==20would be buying AT&T=0F's commercial paper.  So don=0F't get too caught up =in their=20being the only source.TR:  Percentagewise, though, how much better is commercial paper than the==20next-best alternative?Ray:  They would certainly have to pay higher rates.  To the extent that th=ey=20were reliant on the money market funds for a substantial part of their=20commercial paper issuance, those funds would have to be replaced by investo=rs=20who are less constrained by the rating.  You can find those investors, but==20they are obviously looking at a lower rating for a higher pricing.  So it==0F's=20hard to speculate on specifically what any one company might have to pay.TR:  It depends on the day of the week, I=0F'm sure.Ray:  And it also depends on the size of the program, the market=0F's view =of=20how safe the investment is, how comfortable investors are with the company==0F's=20prospects, and how much similar paper there is.A telecom issuer is not only competing against a full range of issuers goin=g=20into the market; it=0F's also competing against other telecom companies for==20access to the market.  Most investors set limits on how much they=0F're wil=ling=20to expose themselves to any particular industry.  Once they feel they have==20enough exposure to the telecom industry, they=0F're going to be less intere=sted=20in putting that next dollar into telecoms rather than some other opportunit=y.The other thing we=0F've seen in the last couple of years is there=0F's bee=n=20tremendous need in the telecom industry for financing as companies have bui=lt=20out their networks.  CLECs have been building networks.  A number of long==20distance networks have been built here in the United States.  Wireless=20networks are being built.  There are also international networks, not only==20connecting countries but also within Europe and within Asia=0F-both wirelin=e and=20wireless.In the U.S. market alone, there was over $70 billion worth of media and=20telecom debt in the first 11 months of 2000, compared to about $55 billion =in=201999.  That=0F's just the straight debt market, not including equities or==20convertible debts.TR:  How do you determine a company=0F's rating?Ray:  We look at the business risks of a company.  We try to understand=20exactly what business they=0F're in, their competitive position, and their==20strengths and weaknesses.  We also try to get a good understanding of=20management and what their appetites may be for business and financial risk.We rate virtually all major companies in virtually every industry.  We also==20have a solid understanding of the industry broadly and where any particular==20company fits in terms of its cost structure, market share, management=20direction, and strategic focus.We also, obviously, do some statistical analysis.  Since we=0F're fixed-inc=ome=20analysts, we=0F're focused more on ensuring that debt obligations get paid =and=20trying to assess the probability that all obligations will be paid in full =in=20a timely manner.A fixed-income investor doesn=0F't necessarily have the upside that an equi=ty=20holder does.  A fixed-income holder has one of two results if he buys a=20security at issuance and holds it to maturity:  He either gets paid or he==20doesn=0F't.Even if the company=0F's been fabulously successful, he just gets his inter=est=20on a regular basis and the principal at maturity.  If the company just=20struggles through and barely makes it, he=0F's in the same situation.  So t=here=0F's not much upside on straight debt if you=0F're a buy-and-hold investor.As fixed-income analysts, our key measures are the company=0F's ability to==20generate free cash.  That=0F's cash after meeting all fixed obligations, li=ke=20interest and dividends.  We also look at their ability to finance their=20capital spending requirements and their cash-generating capability relative==20to their debt load.If you look at two companies that are basically in the same industry and th=at=20have similar sizes and market positions=0F-with neither one possessing any==20particular competitive advantage in terms of new products=0F-the one that h=as=20the stronger cash generation relative to its debt obligations would have a==20higher rating.Probably the most difficult part of our business is making sure that we are==20consistent in applying our ratings.  I want to make sure my strongest compa=ny=20has the highest rating and my weakest company has the lowest rating.It=0F's also important to make sure that what I call an A1, an A2, or a Baa=3 is=20equivalent to the ratings of anyone else in the corporate finance area,=20whether they=0F're covering auto companies or coal mines.TR:  How much of your time is spent talking to management and trying to=20figure out their plans?  What happens during these talks?Ray:  A large part of our analytical meetings with companies is spent tryin=g=20to understand their strategy, their philosophy, and their appetite for=20business and financial risk, and looking at what the company has done in th=e=20past and how successful they=0F've been in meeting goals that they=0F've se=t for=20themselves.We look at their plans relative to others in the industry and try to make==20sure the strategy and the objectives they=0F've set are reasonable and=20achievable.  The discussion, quite frankly, in the average meeting tends to==20be more about the companies=0F' products and business mix.It=0F's often beneficial having a long-standing relationship with a company==0F's=20management.  You develop a sense of comfort regarding management=0F's abili=ty to=20forecast the risks they face, to come up with plans to address those risks,==20and to develop financial models that are achievable.TR:  It must be an expensive prospect for a company to get its rating=20lowered, and it also may be a bit of an embarrassment.  How do they react t=o=20the possibility of a downgrade?Ray:  We try to have a pretty good ongoing dialogue with a company so that =it=0F's not a matter of calling them up one day and saying, =0F""Oh, by the way, w=e=0F're=20putting you on review for a downgrade.=0F""  To the extent that we develop a=reas=20of concern, we like to bring them to the company=0F's attention=0F-both in =our=20direct face-to-face meetings and in regular ongoing dialogue over the phone=.Obviously no company is ever pleased to be put on review for a downgrade. ==20Our objective, quite frankly, is to make sure that they understand and=20appreciate the position we=0F've taken and that they know why we=0F're doin=g what=20we=0F're doing.Even though they ultimately may disagree with the action, at least we want =to=20make sure that they understand the logic behind the steps we take.  And we==20give them a chance to share with us their view as to why some of our concer=ns=20may be less severe from their perspective.TR:  Do you have any advice for telecom executives, investors, or=20regulators?  What needs to happen for the sector to climb out of its slump?Ray:  For the long distance companies, it=0F's a matter of continuing to ge=t=20their costs in line as best they can, knowing that their revenue is going t=o=20continue to be under a lot of pressure for the foreseeable future.In the wireless segment, the key things are the ability of the wireless=20players to build out their networks at a reasonable cost and to attract=20high-value customers=0F-not only for voice but also for the emerging wirele=ss=20data markets=0F-while maintaining cost structures that will allow them to==20continue to be profitable.There are more national wireless carriers now, and we expect that developme=nt=20will put pressure on pricing.  We don=0F't anticipate that it=0F's going to= be as=20dramatic as the pressure we=0F've seen recently in the voice wireline secto=r. =20But the more competitors you have and the broader their coverage, the great=er=20the risk of continued pricing declines.TR:  We haven=0F't talked much about the Bell companies=0F-the ILECs [incum=bent=20local exchange carriers].  What=0F's your outlook for that sector?Ray:  One argument that Moody=0F's has been making in support of them for a= long=20time is that they have direct contact with their customers, and they=0F're =also=20the ones with the line into the house.  Our ratings on the ILECs are=20certainly the highest we have in the telecom area.  They are, by and large,= a=20strong group of competitors who=0F've demonstrated better stability in thei=r=20customer base and revenue mix than the long distance carriers have.TR:  Does the prospect of greater regulatory oversight figure into your=20calculations regarding the Bells?Ray:  There=0F's a lot of regulatory oversight.  As they seek to get approv=al=20[to provide in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) service],==20that process has taken a bit longer than we would=0F've expected.  We=20anticipated that once the first state and the second state fell, other stat=es=20would follow relatively rapidly.Telecom Sector=0F's Dubious Debts Create Drag on Financial MarketsThe rumblings began in Europe.  The Bank of England issued warnings, follow=ed=20by the Bank of France.

The new regulations were adopted after a court=20challenge alleged voting irregularities in the council=0F's 1999 adoption o=f the=20original rules, which implemented section 106 of the National Historic=20Preservation Act (TR, Aug. 14 and 28; and Sept. 11, 2000).Like many industry officials, Robert L. Hoggarth, senior vice=20president-government relations for the Personal Communications Industry=20Association, has problems with the ACHP=0F's rules.  But he says he hopes t=he=20programmatic agreement on collocations=0F-and perhaps other issues=0F-can h=elp=20speed the antenna-siting process.  Mr. Hoggarth discussed the agreement wit=h=20TR.  An edited excerpt of the conversation follows.TR:  What=0F's your complaint with the process used to adopt the rules that= the=20ACHP approved last November?Hoggarth:  The new rules, in our view, were originally promulgated=0F-or at==20least an attempt was made to promulgate them=0F-back in 1999.  The current==20version that the ACHP passed in the fall was essentially the same rules tha=t=20they attempted to adopt in early 1999.TR: So in your view, the rules that were approved last November and took=20effect in January are pretty much the same as those adopted in 1999?Hoggarth:  The original revisions that took place in early 1999 never legal=ly=20went into effect because they were incorrectly promulgated.  This latest=20effort on the part of ACHP was an attempt to cure the early illegalities. ==20The shortened rulemaking process was, in many respects, a way to rubber-sta=mp=20the original rules.  While it did provide an opportunity for the industry t=o=20suggest changes, not many of those were accepted by the ACHP.TR:  What problems does the wireless industry have with the rules themselve=s?Hoggarth:  The key to the wireless industry is speed to market.  And the=20latest applications of the advisory council rules by state authorities and =by=20the federal government have created additional potential for real delays fo=r=20the industry in the processing of new antenna-site requests.TR: Why have the rules hurt the antenna-siting process?  Is the wireless=20industry asking to be treated differently from other industries?Hoggarth:  No.  What=0F's happened is the new process has upped the ante wi=th=20respect to the level of review by state and local authorities.  The challen=ge=20that the industry has found is that in implementing those rules, many state==20historic preservation officers and many other stakeholders have used it as =an=20opportunity to almost step in and take an approval role, as opposed to an==20advisory role. . .It=0F's the FCC that approves the antenna sites as oppose=d to=20the state historic preservation officers or the ACHP.TR: So you see the ACHP as trying to have a greater role than it=0F's allow=ed=20under the law?Hoggarth:  Correct.  Our goal is to make sure that historic preservation=20issues are addressed and that they=0F're looked at in a responsible way. ==20Resources should be devoted to those sites that are going to present real==20challenges for cultural and historic preservation, as opposed to the creati=on=20of an additional bureaucracy that does nothing but cause more pressure and==20work for state and local authorities, significantly increase the processing==20cost for carriers and tower companies, and delay the approval of those=20facilities.TR:A telecom working group has drafted a programmatic agreement to streamli=ne=20the antenna collocation process.  What=0F's the purpose of such an agreemen=t?Hoggarth:  The efforts to come up with a collocation agreement, as well as==20previous efforts of the telecommunications working group, were attempts to==20address the overall industry concern about the ACHP rules and processes.Our goal was to bite off manageable chunks of the problem so we could resol=ve=20some things in the very short term and provide immediate benefits to the=20historic preservation community and the industry.  This is a billion-dollar==20issue overall, with respect to compliance, speed of service delays, and=20additional obligations, both at the state and local levels.And collocation is one way to take a significant chunk out of that=20billion-dollar burden.  Since last summer there have been active negotiatio=ns=20on issues such as delegation and collocation, in an effort to resolve some==20short-term, immediate goals.  A group within the telecommunications working==20group established by the ACHP reached consensus on a collocation proposal.But what arose in the late fall was significant concern on the ACHP=0F's si=de as=20to how to implement any agreement reached by the telecommunications working==20group.  As a result, the ACHP authorized negotiations between the ACHP and==20the FCC to reach a programmatic agreement with respect to the collocation o=f=20new antenna facilities on existing structures and buildings.A general consensus was reached in the fall as to what that would look like=. =20The latest efforts, with respect to the programmatic agreement, focus on th=e=20real desire=0F-on the part of both industry and government=0F-to have a spe=cific=20agreement that has some teeth to it, that has some consistency to it, that==20everyone can be willing to abide by. . .The negotiations have become very complicated.  We at PCIA and the tower=20industry have been working with the ACHP, the FCC, and the state historic==20preservation officer community to reach agreements on language that satisfi=es=20the goals of preserving historic properties in a responsible manner.TR:  So the devil is in the details, it seems.  PCIA asked the FCC to amend==20the draft agreement it sought comment on last month.  So did the Cellular==20Telecommunications & Internet Association.Hoggarth:  Certainly from our industry=0F's perspective, the draft agreemen=t=20that was put on public notice is not our ideal.  It=0F's simply a matter no=w of=20word-smithing, and we want to make sure that the appropriate administrative==20rules are observed.TR:  Ideally how would a programmatic agreement streamline the collocation==20process?Hoggarth:  What it would do is allow the industry to put antennas on existi=ng=20facilities without individual review, thereby minimizing the impact on the==20environment by limiting the number of new towers that go up.The programmatic agreement will have very specific parameters in which the==20historic preservation community will be assured that new facilities will go==20through a process of review.  There=0F'll be assurance that the existing=20structure on which the collocation is taking place already has undergone a==20measure of review, or that any significant site changes created by=20collocation will be appropriately reviewed by local authorities.TR:Under this streamlined approach, what percentage of antennas no longer==20would have to undergo review by historic preservation officials?Hoggarth:  Our hope is that, as a result of the programmatic agreement, we==20would eliminate 80% to 85% of the reviews by state and federal authorities.The present system anticipates significant review of literally every new=20antenna that=0F's sited in a community.  And with collocation, that=0F's si=mply not=20necessary.TR:  Is there a sense for how many antennas that 80% to 85% represents?Hoggarth:  No, it=0F's hard to say.

They involve the role of the FCC and the role of the industry in==20terms of application reviews, the use of authorized consultants to conduct==20the reviews, and the role of the ACHP v. the role of the state historic=20preservation officers.

Do you think that=0F's still realistic?Hoggarth:  There are various expectations that folks are bringing to the=20table.  The reality is that we thought collocation was something that could==20be resolved in a 60-day time frame, and it=0F's now taken four months.  And= that=0F's just one issue that we thought we had broad consensus on within the=20telecommunications working group.As a result, it=0F's just a practical view that a broader programmatic agre=ement=20is going to take a lot of hard work.

The new regulations were adopted after a court=20challenge alleged voting irregularities in the council=0F's 1999 adoption o=f the=20original rules, which implemented section 106 of the National Historic=20Preservation Act (TR, Aug. 14 and 28; and Sept. 11, 2000).Like many industry officials, Robert L. Hoggarth, senior vice=20president-government relations for the Personal Communications Industry=20Association, has problems with the ACHP=0F's rules.  But he says he hopes t=he=20programmatic agreement on collocations=0F-and perhaps other issues=0F-can h=elp=20speed the antenna-siting process.  Mr. Hoggarth discussed the agreement wit=h=20TR.  An edited excerpt of the conversation follows.TR:  What=0F's your complaint with the process used to adopt the rules that= the=20ACHP approved last November?Hoggarth:  The new rules, in our view, were originally promulgated=0F-or at==20least an attempt was made to promulgate them=0F-back in 1999.  The current==20version that the ACHP passed in the fall was essentially the same rules tha=t=20they attempted to adopt in early 1999.TR: So in your view, the rules that were approved last November and took=20effect in January are pretty much the same as those adopted in 1999?Hoggarth:  The original revisions that took place in early 1999 never legal=ly=20went into effect because they were incorrectly promulgated.  This latest=20effort on the part of ACHP was an attempt to cure the early illegalities. ==20The shortened rulemaking process was, in many respects, a way to rubber-sta=mp=20the original rules.  While it did provide an opportunity for the industry t=o=20suggest changes, not many of those were accepted by the ACHP.TR:  What problems does the wireless industry have with the rules themselve=s?Hoggarth:  The key to the wireless industry is speed to market.  And the=20latest applications of the advisory council rules by state authorities and =by=20the federal government have created additional potential for real delays fo=r=20the industry in the processing of new antenna-site requests.TR: Why have the rules hurt the antenna-siting process?  Is the wireless=20industry asking to be treated differently from other industries?Hoggarth:  No.  What=0F's happened is the new process has upped the ante wi=th=20respect to the level of review by state and local authorities.  The challen=ge=20that the industry has found is that in implementing those rules, many state==20historic preservation officers and many other stakeholders have used it as =an=20opportunity to almost step in and take an approval role, as opposed to an==20advisory role. . .It=0F's the FCC that approves the antenna sites as oppose=d to=20the state historic preservation officers or the ACHP.TR: So you see the ACHP as trying to have a greater role than it=0F's allow=ed=20under the law?Hoggarth:  Correct.  Our goal is to make sure that historic preservation=20issues are addressed and that they=0F're looked at in a responsible way. ==20Resources should be devoted to those sites that are going to present real==20challenges for cultural and historic preservation, as opposed to the creati=on=20of an additional bureaucracy that does nothing but cause more pressure and==20work for state and local authorities, significantly increase the processing==20cost for carriers and tower companies, and delay the approval of those=20facilities.TR:A telecom working group has drafted a programmatic agreement to streamli=ne=20the antenna collocation process.  What=0F's the purpose of such an agreemen=t?Hoggarth:  The efforts to come up with a collocation agreement, as well as==20previous efforts of the telecommunications working group, were attempts to==20address the overall industry concern about the ACHP rules and processes.Our goal was to bite off manageable chunks of the problem so we could resol=ve=20some things in the very short term and provide immediate benefits to the=20historic preservation community and the industry.  This is a billion-dollar==20issue overall, with respect to compliance, speed of service delays, and=20additional obligations, both at the state and local levels.And collocation is one way to take a significant chunk out of that=20billion-dollar burden.  Since last summer there have been active negotiatio=ns=20on issues such as delegation and collocation, in an effort to resolve some==20short-term, immediate goals.  A group within the telecommunications working==20group established by the ACHP reached consensus on a collocation proposal.But what arose in the late fall was significant concern on the ACHP=0F's si=de as=20to how to implement any agreement reached by the telecommunications working==20group.  As a result, the ACHP authorized negotiations between the ACHP and==20the FCC to reach a programmatic agreement with respect to the collocation o=f=20new antenna facilities on existing structures and buildings.A general consensus was reached in the fall as to what that would look like=. =20The latest efforts, with respect to the programmatic agreement, focus on th=e=20real desire=0F-on the part of both industry and government=0F-to have a spe=cific=20agreement that has some teeth to it, that has some consistency to it, that==20everyone can be willing to abide by. . .The negotiations have become very complicated.  We at PCIA and the tower=20industry have been working with the ACHP, the FCC, and the state historic==20preservation officer community to reach agreements on language that satisfi=es=20the goals of preserving historic properties in a responsible manner.TR:  So the devil is in the details, it seems.  PCIA asked the FCC to amend==20the draft agreement it sought comment on last month.  So did the Cellular==20Telecommunications & Internet Association.Hoggarth:  Certainly from our industry=0F's perspective, the draft agreemen=t=20that was put on public notice is not our ideal.  It=0F's simply a matter no=w of=20word-smithing, and we want to make sure that the appropriate administrative==20rules are observed.TR:  Ideally how would a programmatic agreement streamline the collocation==20process?Hoggarth:  What it would do is allow the industry to put antennas on existi=ng=20facilities without individual review, thereby minimizing the impact on the==20environment by limiting the number of new towers that go up.The programmatic agreement will have very specific parameters in which the==20historic preservation community will be assured that new facilities will go==20through a process of review.  There=0F'll be assurance that the existing=20structure on which the collocation is taking place already has undergone a==20measure of review, or that any significant site changes created by=20collocation will be appropriately reviewed by local authorities.TR:Under this streamlined approach, what percentage of antennas no longer==20would have to undergo review by historic preservation officials?Hoggarth:  Our hope is that, as a result of the programmatic agreement, we==20would eliminate 80% to 85% of the reviews by state and federal authorities.The present system anticipates significant review of literally every new=20antenna that=0F's sited in a community.  And with collocation, that=0F's si=mply not=20necessary.TR:  Is there a sense for how many antennas that 80% to 85% represents?Hoggarth:  No, it=0F's hard to say.  What we=0F're trying to do is create a= system=20that not only ensures that current sites remain in place and aren=0F't subj=ect=20to review, but also that going forward a large number of new sites will be==20collocations.TR:  Where has the opposition come from to the collocation agreement?Hoggarth:  The concerns expressed by the historic preservation community=20center around language that ensures that there are no significant loopholes=,=20and we certainly agree with that.TR:  Isn=0F't it also correct that some historic preservation officers have= been=20concerned that they won=0F't have the same review authority on collocations= that=20they currently have?Hoggarth:  I think the concern is a combination of that, plus just a=20lack-of-control issue, which says, =0F""My goodness, I don=0F't have the opp=ortunity=20to review what sort of sites are going to go up.=0F""The reality is that the wireless industry is expanding so significantly and==20so greatly that historic preservation officers simply don=0F't have the tim=e to=20review every new project. =20They simply don=0F't need to review every one of them, given the lack of ad=verse=20impacts from so many of these collocations.TR: In addition to collocation, what are some of the wireless industry=0F's==20other regulatory concerns that are being discussed by the telecom working==20group?Hoggarth:  They involve such things as the time periods in which reviews ar=e=20required.  They involve the role of the FCC and the role of the industry in==20terms of application reviews, the use of authorized consultants to conduct==20the reviews, and the role of the ACHP v. the role of the state historic=20preservation officers.  Literally all aspects of the advisory council=0F's =rules=20are touched on.TR:  ACHP officials have said they=0F'd like to vote at their meeting in Ma=rch=20on a broader programmatic agreement that includes many of these issues in==20addition to collocation.  Do you think that=0F's still realistic?Hoggarth:  There are various expectations that folks are bringing to the=20table.  The reality is that we thought collocation was something that could==20be resolved in a 60-day time frame, and it=0F's now taken four months.  And= that=0F's just one issue that we thought we had broad consensus on within the=20telecommunications working group.As a result, it=0F's just a practical view that a broader programmatic agre=ement=20is going to take a lot of hard work.  I can=0F't give you any predictions o=n=20time, because if we=0F're fortunate and if things break the right way, we m=ight=20be able to accomplish things sooner rather than later.But I=0F'm optimistic.  It=0F's going to take a tremendous amount of work o=ver the=20next year to actually bring something to fruition.We continue to work on individual issues with the ACHP.  We=0F've establish=ed=20very positive working relationships with the NCSHPO organization, and we ar=e=20building relationships with various tribal representatives as well, so that==20we can really address all aspects of cultural and historical preservation.What=0F's Ahead. . .FEBRUARY5=0F-The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington will hear oral arguments in=20National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc., v.

OremlandFCC Focuses on International Detariffing, Intercarrier Compensation in=20Biennial ReviewThe FCC has asked its staff to prepare proposals to eliminate or streamline= a=20broad range of Commission rules, including those governing intercarrier=20compensation for terminating telecom traffic, wireless licensing terms and==20renewals, and international service tariffs for nondominant interexchange==20carriers.The FCC issued its directives in a report released Jan. 17 in Common Carrie=r=20docket 00-175.  The biennial regulatory review provisions of the=20Communications Act of 1934 require the agency in even-numbered years to=20decide whether given rules remain in the public interest, the FCC said. =20The FCC doesn=0F't have to take final action repealing or modifying the rul=es in=20the even-numbered years, it said.The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revis=ed=20version of the September 2000 staff report on the biennial regulatory revie=w=20(TR, Sept. 25, 2000).  The FCC wants the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare==20rulemaking notices on the following:=0F=07   Identifying alternative approaches to inter-carrier compensation ==0F""that=20are more consistent with the long-term development of competition=0F"";=0F=07   Excluding rural telcos from the requirements that independent incu=mbent=20local exchange carriers provide interexchange service through separate=20subsidiaries;=0F=07  Simplifying FCC review of the =0F""average schedules=0F"" used in det=ermining=20certain telcos=0F' costs and shares of the National Exchange Carrier=20Association, Inc.=0F's revenue pools; and=0F=07  Changing the schedule for NECA board elections to reduce the=20administrative costs of the association, which was created by FCC directive==20to maintain access charge tariffs for many local exchange carriers.The International Bureau will prepare rulemaking notices to initiate the=20following streamlining efforts:=0F=07  Extending the detariffing regime adopted for domestic interexchange==20services to the international services of nondominant interexchange carrier=s,=20=0F""including commercial mobile radio service providers and U.S. carriers==20classified as dominant solely because of foreign affiliations=0F"";=0F=07 Further streamlining the earth station and space station licensing==20processes;=0F=07 Requiring electronic filing of applications for earth station licens=es, to=20save processing time;=0F=07 Expanding the availability of pro forma transfers of control and=20assignments of international facilities authorizations under section 214 of==20the Communications Act of 1934; and=20=0F=07 Reducing the reporting burdens for international telecom carriers.The FCC asked the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to prepare rulemaking==20notices to pursue the following streamlining goals:=0F=07 Considering whether to eliminate restrictions =0F""on the aggregate a=mount of=20broadband PCS (personal communications service), cellular, and specialized==20mobile radio spectrum that an entity can hold in any market=0F"";=0F=07 Extending license terms beyond 10 years and implementing automatic o=r=20default renewal procedures to avoid late-filing problems;=0F=07 Considering partially privatizing the site-by-site, frequency-by-fre=quency=20licensing process for the private and common carrier microwave services;=0F=07 Bringing the technical and operational rules=0F-including radiated p=ower=20restrictions=0F-for cellular service, PCS, and general wireless communicati=ons=20service into conformity with each other;=0F=07 Considering whether any of its part 22 (cellular) rules are obsolete= as a=20result of competitive or technological developments; and=0F=07 Bringing its radio frequency emission regulations into compliance wi=th the=20International Telecommunication Union=0F's radio regulations.And the Commission asked its Office of Engineering and Technology to prepar=e=20rulemaking notices to address the following issues:=0F=07 Clarifying a variety of equipment authorization rules and eliminatin=g=20ambiguities in equipment test procedures, including authorization procedure=s=20for transmitters that operate both in the U.S. and overseas; and=0F=07 Reviewing the emission limits on devices that operate in spectrum ab=ove 2=20gigahertz.The FCC also agreed with a staff recommendation that when it evaluates new==20rules, it should use criteria similar to that used in the biennial review t=o=20evaluate existing rules.  It stopped short, however, of adopting any criter=ia=20in binding rules or procedures.The FCC rejected a proposal the U.S. Telecom Association had offered in=20comments on the September staff report (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).  USTA had asked==20the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified a=s=20unnecessary during biennial reviews.Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain==20flexibility, the FCC directed all bureaus and offices =0F""to prioritize=20rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of==20various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of=20comments received=0F"" in response to the planned rulemaking notices.Issuing a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W.

But NTIA said that step=s=20to mitigate interference probably would be necessary.NTIA has been studying the interference potential of UWB devices since last==20year as part of a rulemaking proceeding launched by the FCC to explore=20allowing UWB devices to operate on an unlicensed basis under part 15 of its==20rules (TR, Nov. 6, 2000).Separate tests of UWB devices=0F' effect on Global Positioning System (GPS)==20receivers are expected to be released next month.  The test results release=d=20last week involved only non-GPS operations.Results Will Aid Decision MakingNTIA Administrator Gregory L.

Proponents of the==20technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications, including law==20enforcement, fire and rescue services, the military, medicine, education, a=nd=20home and office local area networks (TR, Sept 18, 2000).  They say it won==0F't=20interfere with existing systems.But aviation groups, the GPS and satellite industries, and others have=20expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems. ==20They=0F've asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show t=hey=20won=0F't cause such interference.In its tests, NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices =on=20federal air-route surveillance radar, airport surveillance radar, and air==20traffic control beacon systems.Based on the results of those tests, NTIA engineers developed mathematical==20models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems, includin=g=20those operating between 3100 and 5650 megahertz, or 3.1 and 5.65 GHz.  The==20tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range, although limits=20might need to be placed on power levels, distance, and pulse-repetition=20frequency.  However, there=0F's a question about whether UWB devices would =have=20a =0F""big enough window=0F"" to operate if restrictions are imposed, Mr. Roh=de said.Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users (3.7=0F-4.2 GHz), micr=owave=20landing services (5.03=0F-5.091 GHz), and Doppler weather radar (5.6=0F-5.6=5 GHz). =20For FSS systems, =0F""the worst-case situation=0F"" with regard to interferen=ce =0F""would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna=20elevation angle of 5 degrees,=0F""  NTIA=0F's report said.

Among the issues to be decided are==20the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and==20which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement.NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said the rules could bolster a high-lev=el=20effort to identify and allocate spectrum for third-generation (3G) wireless==20services.  Then-President Clinton launched the initiative by executive=20memorandum in October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan=.=208).As part of that effort, NTIA is studying the possible use of the 1755=0F-18=50=20megahertz band, which is used heavily by the Defense Department.  The FCC i=s=20analyzing use of the 2500=0F-2690 MHz band, which is used mostly by multich=annel=20multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service==20operators.NTIA=0F's proposed rules would cover such future reallocations, Mr. Rohde s=aid=20at an industry-government meeting on the 3G plan last week.  He said he hop=ed=20the final rules would be released this summer.The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 required privat=e=20entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or==20modifying their systems because of reallocation.  The notice of proposed=20rulemaking NTIA released Jan. 17 suggests ways to implement that mandate. ==20Comments are due March 19 with replies due April 18 in docket no.=20001206341-0341-01.In its rulemaking notice, NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government==20spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technicall=y=20possible in their present bands.If the incumbents are not required to relocate, under what conditions shoul=d=20they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for an=y=20system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing? NTIA asks.  For==20example, it asks, should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the ba=nd=20on a noninterference basis with 3G systems?NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a =0F=""comparable facility=0F"" is available for a reasonable period of time.  It==20defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operationa=l=20capabilities as the original spectrum.  NTIA suggests using four factors to==20determine comparability:  (1) communications throughput, (2) system=20reliability, (3) operating costs, and (4) operational capability.  It seeks==20comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient.NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement. ==20It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs,=20including a mandatory negotiation period, third-party mediation, and=20nonbinding arbitration.NTIA seeks comments on what type of cost-sharing plan to adopt and asks=20whether a =0F""band manager=0F"" or some other entity should serve as a clear=inghouse=20to administer the plan.  And it wants input on whether it should =0F""sunset==0F"" a=20cost-sharing plan five years after any auction of former government=20spectrum.  The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectru=m=20with classified frequency assignments.At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the==20Balanced Budget Act of 1997, NTIA identified 255 MHz of spectrum that can b=e=20reallocated from federal government to private use.  The bands identified f=or=20which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are 216=0F-220 MHz=,=201432=0F-1435 MHz, 1710=0F-1755 MHz, and 2385=0F-2390 MHz.The FCC has proposed allocating the 1710=0F-1755 MHz band for 3G services. = In=20addition, Mr. Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the 1755=0F=-1850=20MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the 3G initiative.Rohde Uncertain of Effort=0F's FutureAt last week=0F's 3G meeting, Mr. Rohde said he didn=0F't know if the Bush==20administration would make any changes to the 3G effort, which is operating =on=20a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for 3G spectrum b=y=20Sept. 30, 2002.  But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings==20with Bush transition team staff members.  =0F""I can=0F't predict what=0F's =going to=20happen=0F"" beyond Inauguration Day, Mr. Rohde told reporters.The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA, James Derderian=,=20a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee, couldn==0F't=20be reached for comment.  But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce=20secretary earlier this month, Donald L. Evans said the Bush administration==20was committed to finding 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).Industry Expresses FrustrationAt last week=0F's meeting, several industry representatives expressed=20frustration that they didn=0F't have access to data they said they needed t=o=20make recommendations on use of the 1755=0F-1850 MHz and 2500=0F-2690 MHz ba=nds in=20time for NTIA and the FCC to consider.  Industry representatives in=20NTIA-established working groups are reviewing the bands.The 3G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released i=n=20March, with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in Ju=ly.Rick Kemper, director-wireless technology and security for the Cellular=20Telecommunications & Internet Association, said determining the cost of=20relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible==20requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how==20they are being used.  But he said that data wasn=0F't available.Donald Brittingham, director-wireless policy for Verizon Wireless, said he==20was concerned that the final band studies wouldn=0F't reflect all the indus=try=0F's=20input.  He urged the regulators to delay releasing the reports.=0F""One concern is we=0F're going to do a lot of work and in the end it wil=l be too=20late to be included in your final report,=0F"" added Joanne C.

AT&T was=20challenging the PSC=0F's 1997 arbitration decision regarding its interconne=ction=20agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.Section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed state commission=s=20to review, approve, and, when necessary, arbitrate carrier interconnection==20agreements.  The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission==20determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropria=te=20federal district court to the review the carrier agreement.In AT&T Communications v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., et al. (case==20no. 99-30421), the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the U.S. District Cou=rt=20in Baton Rouge.  The lower court had held that the 11th Amendment to the U.=S.=20Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees. ==20(AT&T had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit).The 11th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts=. =20But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the U.S.==20Supreme Court in its 1908 decision in Ex parte Young.  The Ex parte Young==20doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoin=g=20violations of federal law.The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their==20constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the=20interconnection dispute under the provisions of the 1996 Act.  The court al=so=20ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to AT&T=0F's request for=20prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that AT&T had=20argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections 251 and 252==20of the Act.The appeals court reversed the district court=0F's ruling and remanded the =case=20for further proceedings.  Circuit Judge James L. Dennis wrote the opinion a=nd=20was joined by Judge Henry A. Politz.  Judge Jerry E. Smith dissented from t=he=20majority=0F's opinion.Finding Echoes Other CircuitsAppeals courts in the Sixth, Seventh, and 10th Circuits already have held==20that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to=20state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection agreements (TR=,=20April 5 and Oct. 25, 1999; and Jan. 24, June 26, and July 31, 2000).  Last==20fall, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the issue in a case arising =in=20the Sixth Circuit (TR, Oct. 9, 2000).In his dissent, Judge Smith cited the U.S. Supreme Court=0F's 1996 decision= in=20Seminole Tribe v.

Under that ruling, he said, Congress=0F' referr=al of=20disputes surrounding state commission=0F-arbitrated interconnection agreeme=nts =0F""supplants=0F"" a party=0F's ability to sue the state commission under the 19=08=20Supreme Court decision in Ex parte Young.  But, he added, Congress=0F' refe=rral=20of such disputes to the federal courts violates the 11th Amendment to the==20Constitution.The Chicago-based Seventh Circuit rejected a similar argument last year in==20which state utility commissioners had invoked Seminole Tribe (TR, July 31,==202000).AeA Seeking Federal Preemption Of Multiple State Privacy LawsLawmakers in the 107th Congress should make federal preemption of multiple==20state privacy laws =0F""one of the top legislative concerns=0F"" for the comi=ng=20session, according to AeA, formerly the American Electronics Association. ==20Federal privacy legislation =0F""should play a crucial role=0F"" in maintaini=ng=20consistency and certainty=0F"" in the marketplace, said William T.

That=0F's the message the National Telephone Cooperative Associa=tion=20is carrying to the FCC and Congress as it seeks to garner more federal=20support for some of its pet projects.On Capitol Hill, NTCA plans to revive its legislative push to eliminate cap=s=20on the amount that individual carriers are eligible to receive in universal==20service support, says Chief Executive Officer Michael Brunner.  The=20association is considering broadening that proposal to include a broadband==20tax credit plan, he says.At the FCC, the group=0F's most pressing concern is getting quick adoption =of=20the multiassociation group (MAG) plan for overhauling the interstate access==20charge system for telcos operating under rate-of-return regulation, Mr.=20Brunner tells TR.  An edited transcript of our conversation follows.TR:  What are NTCA=0F's top priorities for the 107th Congress?  Should we e=xpect=20to see your proposal from the last Congress to lift the universal service c=ap?Brunner:  The answer is yes.  As you know, we were instrumental in working==20with [Sen. Conrad] Burns [R., Mont.] in getting that bill introduced in the==20last session.  Obviously that=0F's a priority again, as the Rural Task Forc=e has=20sort of come up with half a loaf in recommending an index cap.We see the Rural Task Force plan as better obviously than the current=20situation, but we see it causing a problem down the road.  For example, if =a=20lot of acquisitions occur=0F-and I think they will=0F-then there=0F's going= to be a=20need to upgrade all those lines. =20The current cap won=0F't be adequate to do that, and we hope the Commission=,=20under any circumstances, wouldn=0F't go below what the Rural Task Force is==20recommending.TR:  That effort garnered bipartisan backing from key U.S. senators last=20session.  What=0F's your strategy for expanding congressional support for i=t in=20the 107th Congress?Brunner:  One way to do that might be to go back to the drafting of the=20Telecommunications Act of 1996, when Congress really understood that we hav=e=20to give equal weight to the twin goals of competition and universal service=. =20Our feeling is that this Commission and the past Commissions, perhaps, may==20have given more weight to competition and less to universal service.It=0F's real clear in the statute that Congress thinks those issues are equ=ally=20weighted, and whether or not people like it, things cost more in rural=20America.  If we really want to bring broadband services to all Americans, w=e=20can=0F't do it without some kind of support. =20And if Congress is saying on the one hand, =0F""Deploy advanced services,=0F="" it=20seems odd to say on the other hand, =0F""We=0F're going to limit this cap, l=imit the=20support.=0F""Rep. Nathan Deal [R., Ga.] was our key guy in the House on this last year,==20and Sen. Burns in the Senate.  We=0F're working with a lot of other people,= too,=20to see if we can=0F't be more comprehensive this time around.For example, another key component of our plan could be some kind of tax=20credit or a low-interest [Rural Utilities Service] loan.  And rather than==20have one bill address this part and one for that part, we may have all of==20those wind up in one comprehensive package.On the broadband tax credit plan, the idea is to develop. . .a bill that=20would enable carriers to claim a fairly substantial credit for deploying=20broadband services to rural areas.  We don=0F't want it to be technology-==20specific, where you end up with something that seems to favor one technolog=y=20over the other.I don=0F't want to be too specific because we=0F're still working with a nu=mber of=20our own members to work out the details.  We don=0F't have a perfect packag=e=20yet. . .and I don=0F't think it would be hugely expensive.  We realize no o=ne=0F's=20going to go for a big spending bill, especially with the economy sort of=20turning right now, or potentially turning.But we=0F're still moving forward on this.  Our annual meeting will be held= the=20first week in February, and that=0F's when we=0F're really going to start h=ashing=20out some of these things and talking about some overall policy resolutions.TR:  One thing you haven=0F't mentioned is a deregulatory approach to broad=band=20service deployment.  Why?Brunner:  We really haven=0F't been drawn to that approach for a lot of rea=sons,=20one being that we think a broadband tax credit bill is a more targeted=20approach that really gets at the issue.  If the policy-makers really want t=o=20deploy broadband services nationwide, and they say they do, this is the way==20to help us to do it.TR:  Staying on the congressional front, what=0F's NTCA=0F's reaction to Fr=ed Upton=20[R., Mich.], who has limited telecom experience, being named chairman of th=e=20House Energy and Commerce Committee=0F's telecommunications subcommittee?Brunner:  We=0F're excited about Fred Upton being in that role.  He does ha=ve=20some rural parts to his district; in fact, some of our own commercial telco==20members are up there=0F-Bloomingdale Telephone Co. of Bloomingdale, Mich., =and=20Climax Telephone Co., of Climax, Mich.Also, the ratio now in the House is about 14 urban members to one rural=20member.  So whenever you get a person with some rural territory in a key=20telecom policy-making slot, NTCA is thrilled.  We think that Mr. Upton will==20do a good job and hope he=0F'll be sensitive to NTCA=0F's issues.TR:  I understand that you=0F've been consulting with members of Congress a=bout=20the MAG plan and that some senators have asked the FCC to put it on the fro=nt=20burner.  What kind of time line do you have in mind for action on the MAG==20plan?Brunner:  We want to move it quickly.  We=0F've spent a lot of time, as hav=e=20other trade associations, getting our members on board.  It was a grueling==20process, and I think the product=0F's pretty good.  So our feeling, at this==20point, is that we really want the whole thing adopted as is.We=0F're not comfortable backing off any part of it.  If the Commission doe=s=20back off or review it, then we reserve the right to say, =0F""Stop, and let==0F's=20look at it again.=0F""The main thing is keeping the process moving.  It=0F's easy for things to g=et=20bogged down in the regulatory or congressional processes.  We have many=20friends on Capitol Hill, mainly in the Senate, where so many members have k=ey=20rural areas in their state.  The main message right now is, =0F""Let=0F's ke=ep the=20MAG plan moving.=0F""Most people think it=0F'll probably take six months to a year to get the wh=ole=20thing through.  The other wild card, to some extent, is the Rural Task Forc=e=20report, which is moving along on a fast track.  There=0F's some commonality==20between those two.  Our dream=0F-although we thought it probably wasn=0F't =super=20likely=0F-was that the Commission would just simply adopt the MAG plan as i=s.TR:  What about the expected turnover at the FCC?  How do you see that=20affecting the Com-mission=0F's consideration of the MAG plan?Brunner:  It could go a bunch of different ways.  You could get someone=20coming in who says, =0F""A lot of real smart people spent a lot of time on t=his,=20and rather than reinvent the wheel, I=0F'm more inclined to support it.=0F""Or you could get someone else who says, =0F""I don=0F't understand all this,= and I=20want to start from square one and take my time.=0F""  We just don=0F't know =who the=20players are going to be.  I expect some of the current Commissioners still==20will be there.TR:  Most believe Commissioner Michael K. Powell will be tapped to fill the==20vacant chairman seat, at least initially.  Have you gotten any feedback fro=m=20his office about his position on the MAG plan?Brunner:  Not really.  We=0F've visited the staffs of all the Commissioners=, and=20most of them weren=0F't real specific on [the plan].  So we certainly want =to=20give him and others the benefit of the doubt.  We hope they would view it==20favorably.  I think everyone will respect the work that went into it, even =if=20they don=0F't agree with it.TR:  Let=0F's talk about your recent white paper recommending that universa=l=20service =0F""high-cost=0F"" support be =0F""nonportable=0F"" [TR, Jan. 15].  Ho=w did you come=20to this conclusion, and where do you go with it?Brunner:  What we=0F've got there is a study with some actual data.  It sho=ws=20that introducing competition in rural areas is ultimately going to lead to==20less broadband technology deployment. =20Our next step is to try to convince regulators that artificial competition==20doesn=0F't work.  If there=0F's an actual market for more than one carrier,= then=20indeed consumers might benefit.  But there aren=0F't great public benefits,= as=20we see it, to artificially creating competition where markets don=0F't=20ordinarily permit competition as a matter of course.Our point is that sometimes the regulators try to take an urban solution an=d=20inject it into rural America.  It makes sense to induce competition in=20downtown areas like Los Angeles or Chicago, where the average Bell company==20has anywhere from 130 to 150 customers per mile.  But we only have four or==20five or six per mile=0F-very small numbers.We would argue that it=0F's hard for one carrier to really make it in these==20markets.  And if they force a second one or a third one in, it splits up th=e=20business even more, and no one=0F's going to have the wherewithal to delive=r=20broadband services.One of our main themes on Capitol Hill and at the Commission is that=20policy-makers need to appreciate the fact that rural areas are different. ==20Most policy-makers, as you might imagine, have an urban background. . .Our==20job is to continue to try to educate people about the differences between==20urban and rural areas.We=0F've done that with some success.  For example, we=0F've had several of= the=20Commissioners come out and speak at our meetings, spend time with our=20members, talk with them one-on-one.  [Commissioner Harold W.]=20Furchtgott-Roth, for example, came out and visited a small telco with us.  =We=20really look for opportunities to give them a greater appreciation of these==20kinds of things.Going back to Congress, we also want to really caution people not to reopen==20up the Telecommunications Act or to pass a new Act until some of the key=20rural issues are resolved.  We=0F're now going on five years since passage =of=20the Telecommunications Act, and some of our members still can=0F't plan bec=ause=20they don=0F't know about [the outcome of] access charge reform.  As you kno=w,=20our members get better than 50% of their revenues from access charges.The biggest decisions for the new Commission will be on high-cost support a=nd=20access charge reform.  Both the MAG and the Rural Task Force plans have=20touched on that.TR:  Switching gears to the incoming Bush administration, how do you forese=e=20the Department of Agriculture=0F's Rural Utilities Service [RUS] developing= over=20the next few years?  Will there be major changes?Brunner:  Actually, to be honest, no one knows.  My sense is that the RUS n=o=20longer is the political issue it used to be because when people look at it,==20they=0F're seeing that the cost of that program is so minute.  It=0F's some=where=20around $6 million or $7 million in interest subsidies for about $600 millio=n=20in loans.And everyone thinks it does work well; there=0F's never been a default.  So= I=20don=0F't sense we=0F're going to have an effort, as was made in the Reagan==20administration, to really cut back on some of these things.  I could be=20totally wrong, but my sense is it has enough respect and support on both=20sides of the aisle.Plus, the lending no longer is simply for the same =0F""plain old telephone==20service=0F""; it=0F's now for some new things.TR:  Let=0F's talk about NTCA=0F's membership.  What kind of efforts are un=der way=20to accommodate some of your members=0F' non-ILEC [incumbent local exchange==20carrier] operations?Brunner:  Many years ago there were questions about how our members would==20adapt to change in competition.  My sense is that they=0F're adapting quite==20well, as almost all of them are in multiple lines of business.  They=0F're==20becoming Internet service providers, many of them are in the cable TV=20business, most of them have wireless or broadcast satellite operations, som=e=20are resellers, and many are becoming CLECs [competitive local exchange=20carriers].They=0F've gotten into multiple lines of business, so they are becoming, in= a=20lot of ways, more than ILECs.  We=0F've broadened our approach to assist th=em in=20some other areas.  So it=0F's a very active membership, some more than othe=rs.We have a new initiative called C3A.  It=0F's really an effort to get membe=rs=20who are thinking more competitively to get together and perhaps aggregate==20their businesses with things like volume discounts. =20I=0F've been very pleased with our membership=0F's willingness to grow and =change. =20For a while I thought they just might want to keep doing things the same ol=d=20way that has always worked for them.  But they really are changing.We=0F're not the biggest player.  We=0F're only about 5% of the industry, b=ut it=20really is a critical 5%.  We represent roughly 40% of the land in this=20country, but it=0F's a unique and critical part.We would just really hope that the policy-makers would make it a priority t=o=20understand that the 5% we serve is as important as the whole.  That=0F's=20something that some people miss.Executive BriefingsThe New FCC? =0F- Speculation is rife that a decision on the FCC top spot i=s=20imminent, as FCC transition team advisers meet to discuss potential changes==20at the agency.

The FCC tinkered with its rules governing those==20duties in an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking released in=20Common Carrier dockets 96-98 and 98-147.  The order addressed petitions for==20reconsideration and clarification of a previous order on line sharing (TR,==20Nov. 22, 1999).Line sharing is the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers=20(ILECs) allow competitors to offer high-speed service over the high-frequen=cy=20portion of a loop, while the ILEC continues to offer voice service over the==20low-frequency portion.In the order adopted Jan. 19, the FCC said ILECs must provide line sharing==20over the entire loop even if they=0F've deployed fiber in the loop to suppl=ement=20or replace the original copper line.  The order was one of many actions tha=t=20the FCC took on the last day of Chairman William E.

It=0F's also sparking concern among s=chools=20and libraries that have participated in the program and benefited from it.They=0F're worried that the president=0F's E-rate proposal, if adopted in i=ts=20current =0F""blueprint=0F"" form, would discourage certain schools from apply=ing for=20discounts on telecom and Internet services and internal connections.  In th=e=20long run, they fear that the president=0F's proposal would lead to decrease=d=20funding for the program, which currently stands at $2.25 billion a year.The main problem, these critics say, is that shifting administration of the==20program to the Department of Education, as President Bush has said he inten=ds=20to do, would render E-rate funding dependent on congressional=20appropriations.  In its current form under the FCC=0F's oversight, the prog=ram=20is funded by universal service contributions assessed from telecom carriers=.The technology part of the president=0F's education reform initiative unvei=led=20last week calls for combining the E-rate with several Department of Educati=on=20programs to form one =0F""performance-based technology grant program.=0F""  T=hen, it=20says, funding for that program would be disbursed =0F""by formula=0F"" to sta=tes=20through block grants.The aim is to streamline the many =0F""duplicative technology programs=0F"" i=nto one=20education grant plan, the Bush administration says.

They say more details are needed from the Bush administration on==20several issues, including how the E-rate program would be funded and what==20formula would be used to distribute money among the states.Jeff Burnett, director-government relations at the National Association of==20Independent Schools, says the language of the proposal is cloudy when it=20comes to whether the program would be supported by the Universal Service=20Fund, as it is now, or by general tax revenues.  =0F""That=0F's a huge quest=ion=20mark, and we are highly nervous about it because it does appear that it wou=ld=20become part of the Department of Education=0F's budget,=0F"" he says.Mr. Burnett says making the E-rate dependent on general tax revenues could ==0F""destabilize=0F"" its funding and discourage some private and parochial schoo=ls=20from applying for telecom discounts.  =0F""It would go from where it is now,= a=20pretty stable $2.25 billion per year, to where you would have arguments eve=ry=20year in Congress over how much money it would get.=0F""Plus, he says, E-rate funds =0F""no longer would be string-free=0F"" if they =were to=20be allocated by the federal government.  Moving the program to the Departme=nt=20of Education could discourage religious schools from participating because =of=20potential =0F""church-state problems,=0F"" he says, referring to the First Am=endment=20to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits congressional establishment of an==20official religion.  And some states may be restricted by their state=20constitutions from providing federally funded educational services to priva=te=20and religious schools, he adds.Former FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, who oversaw the implementation of the=20E-rate program back in 1996, fears that the end result could be the =0F""kil=ling=20of the program altogether=0F"" or a =0F""chopping of it down from a significa=nt=20program to an insignificant one.=0F""   =20Having the Education Department oversee the E-rate program would remove=20stability from the program, Mr. Hundt stressed.  =0F""Where are they going t=o=20find 2, 3, or 4 billion dollars in the general [tax revenues] to pay for it=?=0F""=20he asked.  =0F""The bigger [telecom service] providers probably would be hap=py,=20but the [support] would be reduced,=0F"" Mr. Hundt told TR last week.He also rejected the administration=0F's claims that consolidating the educ=ation=20technology programs would reduce applicants=0F' paperwork and filing=20requirements.  =0F""Moving it to the Department of Education is not a way to==20simplify paperwork,=0F"" Mr. Hundt said.  =0F""Nothing is simpler than the wa=y it=0F's=20done now.

Schools and libraries are required to bar access =to=20visual depictions that are =0F""harmful to minors=0F"" only when minors are u=sing the=20computers.The law requires E-rate recipients to certify each program year that they a=re=20complying with the filtering mandate and that they monitor the operation of==20the filtering technology while the computers are in use.  The law allows an==20administrator to disable the filtering technology while the computer is bei=ng=20used by an adult =0F""for bona fide research or other lawful purpose.=0F""Schools and libraries have one year to adopt an Internet safety policy; in==20the first year after the effective date of the law, they either must certif=y=20that they have such a policy or that they are developing one.The law also allows schools and libraries to seek a waiver from the FCC=20during the law=0F's second year, if state or local procurement rules or=20competitive bidding requirements have prevented them from implementing an==20Internet safety policy.The FCC=0F's further notice of proposed rulemaking released last week in Co=mmon=20Carrier docket 96-45 proposes that E-rate recipients this year certify eith=er=20that they have complied with all relevant provisions of the CIPA or that th=e=20CIPA requirements don=0F't apply.  The certifications would appear on their= =0F""receipt of confirmation=0F"" forms (FCC Form 486).The CIPA doesn=0F't require schools and libraries that use E-rate funds onl=y for=20telecom services=0F-and not for Internet access or internal connections=0F-=to=20install the filtering technology.The FCC proposes that in future years recipients include their compliance==20certifications on FCC Form 471, which is used to describe the services to b=e=20funded.  It asks how to implement the =0F""remedial=0F"" provisions of the CI=PA,=20which detail ways an applicant can correct its noncompliance or=20noncertification.  Comments are due 15 days after publication of the=20rulemaking notice in the Federal Register; replies are due 30 days later.The American Library Association has announced plans to challenge the=20constitutionality of the CIPA (TR, Jan. 22), whose Internet-filtering=20requirements extend to other federal programs that subsidize schools=0F' an=d=20libraries=0F' purchases of computers and Internet access.The ALA, which notes that the CIPA takes effect April 20, has launched a We=b=20site where it will post information about its activities regarding the CIPA==20(http://www.ala.org/cipa).Meanwhile, President Bush last week announced a proposal for modifying the==20E-rate program, including reducing the paperwork demands on applicants (see==20separate story).Large Carriers Want 700 MHz Auction Postponed, But Small Providers,=20Broadcasters Oppose DelayLarge wireless carriers are once again asking the FCC to postpone the=20scheduled auction of licenses for the 700 megahertz band, citing a host of==20familiar concerns that they say could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the==20frequencies.But rural carriers and TV broadcasters are urging the Commission to begin t=he=20auction March 6, as scheduled, noting that the sale already has been=20postponed three times.  They say that large carriers have had plenty of tim=e=20to prepare for the auction and that further delays would be unfair to them.They offered their views in comments filed with the FCC last week in respon=se=20to a request by Verizon Wireless to delay the sale until September (TR, Jan=.=2022).  Several large carriers that supported the request asked for an even==20longer postponement.Supporters of postponement cited the presence of broadcasters in the spectr=um=20and the need to negotiate band-clearing agreements as evidence to support==20their cause (see separate story).  Most of their arguments echoed those of==20Verizon Wireless.TV broadcasters don=0F't have to evacuate the spectrum (channels 60=0F-69) =as part=20of the transition to digital TV until 2006 at the earliest.

Wheeler.  A scarcity in=20frequencies is hurting U.S. carriers=0F' competitiveness with their foreign==20counterparts and thwarting development of the wireless Internet, he said.Mr. Wheeler urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier ma=y=20hold in any one market while a high-level effort to identify and allocate==20frequencies for third-generation (3G) services proceeded.  Such a move woul=d=20ease the spectrum crunch, he reasoned.At a briefing for reporters last week, he said the Bush administration had==20its work cut out for it in collaborating with the FCC to find suitable band=s=20for 3G use.U.S. Seen Falling Behind=0F""God bless the Clinton administration for starting the spectrum policy r=eview=20process, but [it] couldn=0F't bring it to fruition, and it now falls to the= Bush=20administration to deal with the really hard parts and to make decisions,=0F="" Mr.=20Wheeler said.=0F""Those decisions will probably take time.

The==20FCC asked for comments on the issue last week (see separate story).He said he had =0F""some very profitable discussions=0F"" with Bush transitio=n team=20officials on spectrum issues, although he wouldn=0F't elaborate.  He also s=aid=20he was pleased that Donald L.

Regarding privacy, he said the==20trade group had gotten a positive response from members of Congress and=20regulators to its proposed principles for location-information services (TR=,=20Oct. 30 and Nov. 27, 2000).Mr. Wheeler defended the industry=0F's claims regarding the safety of mobil=e=20phones.  A new book by George L.

The book is particularly critical of Mr. Wheeler.  The industry==20also has suffered recent setbacks in pending court cases that claim mobile==20phones are dangerous to humans (TR, Jan. 22).=0F""I don=0F't think that the issue is George Carlo or Tom Wheeler or CTIA,==0F"" Mr.=20Wheeler said.  =0F""The whole issue is, What=0F's the science? . . .We=0F've= supported=20independent science and will continue to support independent science.=0F""As for litigation, he said that lawsuits alleging a link between exposure t=o=20radio frequency emissions and health effects such as cancer had been=20dismissed in the past.Nextel Communications, Inc., has agreed to purchase specialized mobile=20radio...Nextel Communications, Inc., has agreed to purchase specialized mobile=20radio(SMR) licenses from Arch Wireless, Inc., for $175 million and invest $=75=20million in the paging carrier.

Nextel said==20the transition would give it about 20 megahertz of SMR spectrum in the 800==20and 900 MHz bands in 52 of the top 100 U.S. markets.Commission Examines Merits Of Lifting CMRS Spectrum CapThe FCC is reexamining whether to lift its cap on the amount of spectrum=20wireless carriers may hold in any one market.  The Commission also is=20considering whether it should eliminate its cellular cross-interest rule.In a notice of proposed rulemaking released last week, the FCC asked for=20comments on whether the spectrum cap should be retained, modified, or=20eliminated to comply with the public-interest standard set forth in section==2011 of the Communications Act, as amended.Specifically, the agency is soliciting views on whether =0F""meaningful econ=omic=20competition=0F"" in the commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) market has=20rendered spectrum aggregation limits, including the cellular cross-interest==20rule, unnecessary.Under the agency=0F's rules, carriers aren=0F't allowed to hold more than 4=5=20megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and 55 MHz in rural markets.  The=20cellular cross-interest rule restricts an entity=0F's ownership interest in==20cellular carriers operating in the same market.  The FCC wants to know=20whether those limits are still needed to prevent harmful concentration of==20spectrum holdings or ensure opportunities for new players to enter the mark=et.The Commission is asking for comments on what constitutes =0F""meaningful=20economic competition=0F"" under section 11 and how competitive conditions ha=ve=20changed since it last reviewed the restrictions in 1999.In the largest metropolitan areas, where seven in 10 Americans live, at lea=st=20five mobile telephone carriers are offering service, the agency noted last==20week.  As a result, it said, prices are declining, coverage areas are=20expanding, and new service packages are being offered.  It wants to know if==20there are public-interest reasons for maintaining the cap regardless of suc=h=20competitive developments.Large wireless carriers have lobbied the FCC to lift the cap, saying it has==20thwarted the U.S. wireless industry=0F's deployment of third-generation (3G=)=20services, placing it at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.  Some=20smaller carriers, however, have asked the FCC to retain the cap, saying it==0F's=20needed to ensure that they remain competitive against their larger=20counterparts.In a broad review of the cap conducted in 1999, the FCC decided to retain t=he=20restriction, although it eased the limit in rural markets (TR, Sept. 20,=201999).  At the time, it concluded that the cap was a safeguard against=20excessive concentration in the CMRS market, preserving competition and the==20consumer benefits it had produced.  It also determined in 1999 that the=20cellular cross-interest restriction was necessary to protect competition. ==20The agency eased the rules somewhat, however, permitting some degree of=20cross-interest.In November 2000, the FCC denied two petitions for reconsideration of its==201999 decision but said it would reexamine the cap as part of its 2000=20biennial review (TR, Nov. 13, 2000).  The notice of proposed rulemaking,=20adopted Jan. 19 and released Jan. 23 in Wireless Telecommunications docket==2001-14, stems from that review.  Comments are due 60 days after the notice==0F's=20publication in the Federal Register, and replies are due 30 days after that=.In a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said that h=e=20supported the rulemaking notice but that he tentatively would have conclude=d=20that the cap should be lifted.=0F""The use of a spectrum cap is a drastic regulatory remedy that continues= to=20search for a corresponding competitive ill,=0F"" he said.  =0F""I have grown==20impatient with the Commission=0F's repeated reexaminations of these issues==20without substantial alterations in our policy approach.=0F""Industry Praises ReviewThomas E. Wheeler, president and chief executive officer of the Cellular=20Telecommunications & Internet Association, said that lifting the cap was=20crucial while a high-level effort to identify and allocate 3G bands winds==20through the regulatory process (see separate story).Mr. Wheeler told reporters at a luncheon last week that such access to=20additional spectrum was necessary for the U.S. to maintain its leadership i=n=20the development of the Internet as it moves to wireless devices.Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencie=s=20for 3G services, setting aside twice as much spectrum as the U.S. has, he==20said.The Personal Communications Industry Association, however, has said the cap==20is necessary to give smaller carriers a chance to enter the CMRS market.Mr. Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell had said =he=20would favor lifting the spectrum cap.  =0F""Clearly in some of the opinions =that=20he=0F's written in the spectrum proceeding, he=0F's asked the question, Why= should=20this continue?=0F"" Mr. Wheeler said.  =0F""We=0F're hopeful.=0F""Then-Commissioner Powell voted to retain the cap in November 2000 but said =he=20tended to agree with Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth=0F's conclusion that the =cap =0F""has outlived its usefulness.=0F""Notice Explores AlternativesIn its rulemaking notice, the FCC seeks comments on alternatives to lifting==20the spectrum cap entirely or leaving it untouched.  For example, it asks=20whether it should apply the cap only to spectrum used for voice services.  =It=20also asks whether it should retain the cap in markets where there is less==20competition and eliminate it in other markets where more carriers are=20offering service.The FCC also solicits opinions on whether to treat already-licensed spectru=m=20differently from frequencies licensed in the future.  =0F""As a general matt=er,=20we believe that newly available CMRS-suitable spectrum either should be=20excluded from the spectrum cap, or, if it is included, that the cap should =be=20adjusted accordingly,=0F"" the Commission said.The FCC also wants opinions on how eliminating or relaxing the cap would=20affect its authority to review license-transfer requests under section 310(=d)=20of the Act.

The FCC previously ruled that requesting carriers can==0F't=20use EELs to provide exchange access services exclusively.The FCC had imposed that prohibition in response to incumbent local exchang=e=20carriers=0F' fears that competitors could use EELS to avoid paying special==20access charges (TR, Sept. 20, 1999).  The Commission later extended the=20prohibition and promised to revisit the issue early this year (TR, June 12,==202000).In a Jan. 24 public notice seeking comments on the issue (Common Carrier=20docket 96-98), the FCC asked if the exchange access and local exchange=20markets were =0F""so interrelated from an economic and technological perspec=tive=20that a finding that a network element meets the =0F`impair=0F' standard und=er=20section 251(d)(2) of the [Telecommunications Act of 1996] for the local=20exchange market would itself entitle competitors to use that network elemen=t=20solely or primarily in the exchange access market.=0F""The =0F""impair=0F"" standard requires the FCC to evaluate whether the failur=e to=20unbundle each network element would impair competitors=0F' ability to provi=de=20service.The FCC asked whether the local exchange and exchange access markets are ==0F""economically and technically distinct.=0F""  If the markets are distinct, do=es=20lack of access to loop-transport combinations impair requesting carriers=0F='=20ability to provide special access services? the FCC asked.It asked about the availability of =0F""alternative elements=0F"" aside from =those=20offered by the incumbents.

One case stems from a challenge of the FCC=0F's==20methodology for setting rates for interconnection and unbundled network=20elements (UNEs).  In a separate case, the court will consider whether the==20agency has authority to regulate the rates utility companies charge wireles=s=20and cable TV service providers for attaching equipment to their utility pol=es.Oral arguments in the cases haven=0F't been scheduled yet.  As she has done= in a=20number of other telecom-related cases, Justice Sandra Day O=0F'Connor recus=ed=20herself from the court=0F's deliberations.In the first case, a federal appeals court had overturned the FCC=0F's use =of=20TELRIC (total-element long-run incremental cost) pricing rules for setting==20rates for interconnection and UNEs (TR, July 24, 2000).The high court said it would focus on the following questions: =20(1)Whether the TELRIC methodology is unlawful under section 252(d)(1) of th=e=20Telecommunications Act of 1996,=20(2)Whether the Act or the =0F""takings clause=0F"" of the Fifth Amendment to =the U.S.=20Constitution requires incorporation of an incumbent local exchange carrier==0F's=20(ILEC=0F's) historical costs in its UNE rates, and=20(3)Whether section 251(c) (3) of the Act prohibits regulators from requirin=g=20that ILECs combine certain previously uncombined network elements at the=20request of a new market entrant.=20The consolidated cases beginning with Verizon Communications, Inc., v. FCC =et=20al.(no. 00-511) came from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit==20(St. Louis).  In what many incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)=20considered a victory, the Eighth Circuit last year overturned the FCC=0F's==20TELRIC pricing rules.  But the court didn=0F't go so far as to agree with I=LECs=20that rates for interconnection and UNEs must be based on historic costs.In the second case, the Supreme Court will consider whether the =0F""pole=20attachment=0F"" provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, ap=ply=20to cable TV facilities that also are used to provide high-speed Internet=20access and to equipment used to provide wireless services.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta) had held that the==20FCC didn=0F't have authority to regulate the rates utilities can charge for==20facilities that Internet or wireless service providers attach to their pole=s=20(TR, April 17, 2000).  The pole attachment provisions apply only to cable T=V=20and wireline telephone services, the appeals court ruled.

The interconnection provisions are included in th=e=20Telecommunications Act of 1996.The 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants states immunity from=20federal lawsuits, but a 1908 Supreme Court decision, Ex parte Young,created==20an exception for lawsuits seeking to prevent an ongoing violation of federa=l=20law by state officials.The high court=0F's action last week left in place a ruling by the U.S. Cou=rt of=20Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago) that the Ex parte Young exception==20applies to lawsuits involving carrier interconnection proceedings.This isn=0F't the first time the Supreme Court has refused to take on such =a=20case.

Determining whether they can pay those and=20future debts is the job of credit-rating agencies like Moody=0F's Investors==20Service.Robert Ray, a senior vice president in the telecom, technology, and media==20group at Moody=0F's, tells TR that some of the biggest names in telecom, li=ke=20AT&T Corp., are in danger of losing top credit ratings and having to pay mo=re=20interest in their next round of funding.  An edited transcript of our=20interview with Mr. Ray follows.TR:  What does Moody=0F's do?  What=0F's your role?Ray:  I=0F'm lead analyst for a number of high-visibility companies in medi=a,=20technology, and telecommunications.  I=0F'm responsible not only for assign=ing=20ratings to companies but also for monitoring those ratings as companies=0F'==20business prospects ebb and flow to make sure that our ratings, once assigne=d,=20continue to be accurate.In case we=0F're no longer comfortable with the rating, it=0F's my responsi=bility=20to make a recommendation to change the rating of a company.TR:  The news about telecom debt levels has been gloomy [see separate=20story].  What=0F's your perspective on the financial health of the telecom==20sector?Ray:  There have been a number of defaults and bankruptcies, particularly==20among the CLECs [competitive local exchange carriers].  There are a number =of=20companies that have tried to enter the market.  Not all the business plans==20were fully funded.As both the equity and the debt markets have become more restricted,=20companies that didn=0F't have a fully funded business plan=0F-that didn=0F'=t have=20enough money on hand or committed money from their bank group to cover thei=r=20cash needs over the next 12 to 18 months=0F-have found themselves in liquid=ity=20crunches relatively quickly.TR:  On the equity side, a lot of analysts were surprised by what happened =in=20the telecom sector.  Is there a similar sense on the credit and debt side==20that investors and their advisers were caught by surprise?Ray:  In the high-yield area many of the companies had relatively low ratin=gs=0F-single-B or Caa.  Those ratings don=0F't necessarily anticipate a certainty= of=20default, but they do reflect a high degree of risk.Even on the investment-grade side, however, we=0F've seen some surprising==20developments=0F-not so much in terms of direction, but in terms of speed=0F=-primarily in the pricing environment for long distance services from=20companies such as AT&T and WorldCom [Inc.] =20We were aware that those prices were going to come under pressure as the Ba=by=20Bells began to get permission to offer long distance service in their home==20markets, as usage moved from wireline to wireless [service], and as usage==20began moving from traditional circuit-switched networks to Internet-deliver=ed=20voice.While we knew there were a lot of pressures that were going to bring pricin=g=20down in that market, the degree of the falloff was a bit of a surprise even==20to us.  As a result, the large long distance carriers have had to scale bac=k=20their expectations for profitability in the voice business.TR:  And as a consequence, their credit ratings have come under downward=20pressure.Ray:  Yes, AT&T has had its long-term rating lowered from A1 to A2, and tha=t=20rating remains on review.  Certainly the pressures from the voice business==20were part of that.  But AT&T is also in the process of breaking itself up==20into three separate businesses.  The review is not only focusing on some of==20the risks that we=0F've talked about, but also the financial structure that= each=20of these businesses will have going forward.We=0F've changed the outlook on Sprint [Corp.] from stable to negative. =20WorldCom retains an A3 rating and a stable outlook.  While they=0F've had s=ome=20pressure like the other players, they had a little more flexibility, under==20the current rating, to absorb some of those pressures.TR:  How big a deal is it to these companies to have their credit rating go==20down a step?  What effect does that have on their day-to-day business?Ray:  On the day-to-day business it has relatively limited impact.  To the==20extent that they would be issuing new debt, a lower credit rating normally==20would result in a higher interest rate.The most critical rating for AT&T is its short-term rating of Prime-1.  If==20they didn=0F't have a Prime-1 rating, they=0F'd be severely limited in thei=r=20ability to sell commercial paper to the money market funds.  [Securities an=d=20Exchange Commission rules limit the amount money market funds can invest in==20companies that don=0F't have top-tier commercial paper ratings, like Prime-=1,=20from at least two rating agencies.  =0F-Ed.]For a company whose commercial paper outstanding has been between $15 billi=on=20and $20 billion, that could result in a significant increase in AT&T=0F's==20funding costs.  They would have to seek out, for the most part, a different==20group of investors.TR:  Is AT&T=0F's Prime-1 rating under review?Ray:  Yes, it is.  Both the A2 long-term rating and our Prime-1 short-term==20rating are on review for possible downgrade.TR:  Can you give me an example of what the cost of money might be to AT&T==20through a money market fund v. the next-best alternative?Ray:  The money market funds would just be one of a number of investors who==20would be buying AT&T=0F's commercial paper.  So don=0F't get too caught up =in their=20being the only source.TR:  Percentagewise, though, how much better is commercial paper than the==20next-best alternative?Ray:  They would certainly have to pay higher rates.  To the extent that th=ey=20were reliant on the money market funds for a substantial part of their=20commercial paper issuance, those funds would have to be replaced by investo=rs=20who are less constrained by the rating.  You can find those investors, but==20they are obviously looking at a lower rating for a higher pricing.  So it==0F's=20hard to speculate on specifically what any one company might have to pay.TR:  It depends on the day of the week, I=0F'm sure.Ray:  And it also depends on the size of the program, the market=0F's view =of=20how safe the investment is, how comfortable investors are with the company==0F's=20prospects, and how much similar paper there is.A telecom issuer is not only competing against a full range of issuers goin=g=20into the market; it=0F's also competing against other telecom companies for==20access to the market.  Most investors set limits on how much they=0F're wil=ling=20to expose themselves to any particular industry.  Once they feel they have==20enough exposure to the telecom industry, they=0F're going to be less intere=sted=20in putting that next dollar into telecoms rather than some other opportunit=y.The other thing we=0F've seen in the last couple of years is there=0F's bee=n=20tremendous need in the telecom industry for financing as companies have bui=lt=20out their networks.  CLECs have been building networks.  A number of long==20distance networks have been built here in the United States.  Wireless=20networks are being built.  There are also international networks, not only==20connecting countries but also within Europe and within Asia=0F-both wirelin=e and=20wireless.In the U.S. market alone, there was over $70 billion worth of media and=20telecom debt in the first 11 months of 2000, compared to about $55 billion =in=201999.  That=0F's just the straight debt market, not including equities or==20convertible debts.TR:  How do you determine a company=0F's rating?Ray:  We look at the business risks of a company.  We try to understand=20exactly what business they=0F're in, their competitive position, and their==20strengths and weaknesses.  We also try to get a good understanding of=20management and what their appetites may be for business and financial risk.We rate virtually all major companies in virtually every industry.  We also==20have a solid understanding of the industry broadly and where any particular==20company fits in terms of its cost structure, market share, management=20direction, and strategic focus.We also, obviously, do some statistical analysis.  Since we=0F're fixed-inc=ome=20analysts, we=0F're focused more on ensuring that debt obligations get paid =and=20trying to assess the probability that all obligations will be paid in full =in=20a timely manner.A fixed-income investor doesn=0F't necessarily have the upside that an equi=ty=20holder does.  A fixed-income holder has one of two results if he buys a=20security at issuance and holds it to maturity:  He either gets paid or he==20doesn=0F't.Even if the company=0F's been fabulously successful, he just gets his inter=est=20on a regular basis and the principal at maturity.  If the company just=20struggles through and barely makes it, he=0F's in the same situation.  So t=here=0F's not much upside on straight debt if you=0F're a buy-and-hold investor.As fixed-income analysts, our key measures are the company=0F's ability to==20generate free cash.  That=0F's cash after meeting all fixed obligations, li=ke=20interest and dividends.  We also look at their ability to finance their=20capital spending requirements and their cash-generating capability relative==20to their debt load.If you look at two companies that are basically in the same industry and th=at=20have similar sizes and market positions=0F-with neither one possessing any==20particular competitive advantage in terms of new products=0F-the one that h=as=20the stronger cash generation relative to its debt obligations would have a==20higher rating.Probably the most difficult part of our business is making sure that we are==20consistent in applying our ratings.  I want to make sure my strongest compa=ny=20has the highest rating and my weakest company has the lowest rating.It=0F's also important to make sure that what I call an A1, an A2, or a Baa=3 is=20equivalent to the ratings of anyone else in the corporate finance area,=20whether they=0F're covering auto companies or coal mines.TR:  How much of your time is spent talking to management and trying to=20figure out their plans?  What happens during these talks?Ray:  A large part of our analytical meetings with companies is spent tryin=g=20to understand their strategy, their philosophy, and their appetite for=20business and financial risk, and looking at what the company has done in th=e=20past and how successful they=0F've been in meeting goals that they=0F've se=t for=20themselves.We look at their plans relative to others in the industry and try to make==20sure the strategy and the objectives they=0F've set are reasonable and=20achievable.  The discussion, quite frankly, in the average meeting tends to==20be more about the companies=0F' products and business mix.It=0F's often beneficial having a long-standing relationship with a company==0F's=20management.  You develop a sense of comfort regarding management=0F's abili=ty to=20forecast the risks they face, to come up with plans to address those risks,==20and to develop financial models that are achievable.TR:  It must be an expensive prospect for a company to get its rating=20lowered, and it also may be a bit of an embarrassment.  How do they react t=o=20the possibility of a downgrade?Ray:  We try to have a pretty good ongoing dialogue with a company so that =it=0F's not a matter of calling them up one day and saying, =0F""Oh, by the way, w=e=0F're=20putting you on review for a downgrade.=0F""  To the extent that we develop a=reas=20of concern, we like to bring them to the company=0F's attention=0F-both in =our=20direct face-to-face meetings and in regular ongoing dialogue over the phone=.Obviously no company is ever pleased to be put on review for a downgrade. ==20Our objective, quite frankly, is to make sure that they understand and=20appreciate the position we=0F've taken and that they know why we=0F're doin=g what=20we=0F're doing.Even though they ultimately may disagree with the action, at least we want =to=20make sure that they understand the logic behind the steps we take.  And we==20give them a chance to share with us their view as to why some of our concer=ns=20may be less severe from their perspective.TR:  Do you have any advice for telecom executives, investors, or=20regulators?  What needs to happen for the sector to climb out of its slump?Ray:  For the long distance companies, it=0F's a matter of continuing to ge=t=20their costs in line as best they can, knowing that their revenue is going t=o=20continue to be under a lot of pressure for the foreseeable future.In the wireless segment, the key things are the ability of the wireless=20players to build out their networks at a reasonable cost and to attract=20high-value customers=0F-not only for voice but also for the emerging wirele=ss=20data markets=0F-while maintaining cost structures that will allow them to==20continue to be profitable.There are more national wireless carriers now, and we expect that developme=nt=20will put pressure on pricing.  We don=0F't anticipate that it=0F's going to= be as=20dramatic as the pressure we=0F've seen recently in the voice wireline secto=r. =20But the more competitors you have and the broader their coverage, the great=er=20the risk of continued pricing declines.TR:  We haven=0F't talked much about the Bell companies=0F-the ILECs [incum=bent=20local exchange carriers].  What=0F's your outlook for that sector?Ray:  One argument that Moody=0F's has been making in support of them for a= long=20time is that they have direct contact with their customers, and they=0F're =also=20the ones with the line into the house.  Our ratings on the ILECs are=20certainly the highest we have in the telecom area.  They are, by and large,= a=20strong group of competitors who=0F've demonstrated better stability in thei=r=20customer base and revenue mix than the long distance carriers have.TR:  Does the prospect of greater regulatory oversight figure into your=20calculations regarding the Bells?Ray:  There=0F's a lot of regulatory oversight.  As they seek to get approv=al=20[to provide in-region interLATA (local access and transport area) service],==20that process has taken a bit longer than we would=0F've expected.  We=20anticipated that once the first state and the second state fell, other stat=es=20would follow relatively rapidly.Telecom Sector=0F's Dubious Debts Create Drag on Financial MarketsThe rumblings began in Europe.  The Bank of England issued warnings, follow=ed=20by the Bank of France.

Huffstutter as""he."" Ms. Huffstutter is a ""she."" We regret the error.TOP GROKS~~~~~~~~~Economists: Relax, This Won't Hurt a BitMost of us like recession speculation about as much as we like tetanusshots. A business forecast from UCLA brought out the big needle onMonday and predicted a 60 percent chance of the r-word in 2001. Likeyour doctor, the UCLA economists said it would only pinch a little,and then it would all be over.CBS MarketWatch, Newsbytes and MSNBC provided good summaries of thereport, which insisted everything would be peachy again in 2002.Newsbytes' Michael Bartlett led with some encouragement for deflatedtechie egos: ""The stimulus of the Internet-led 'New Economy' wasenough to keep the current economic expansion in the United Statesdriving forward for four years longer than it might have,"" he said,paraphrasing the report. Funny how everyone's putting ""new economy"" inquotes these days - it used to seem so real.The San Jose Mercury News called the predicted downturn ""recessionlite"" and noted that local California readers ""will escape the worstof it."" (A separate UCLA report on California put the odds of astatewide recession at 40 percent; report author Tom Lieser prefersthe term ""deceleration."") Many experts expect 3 percent growth nextyear, so the Merc's Jennifer Bjorhus called other economist to comparenotes. One Bay Area econ professor agreed that we may be in trouble,but the UCLA report ""has other economists scratching their heads,""said Bjorhus. ""I don't know of anybody else that's out there thatfar,"" said economist Richard Carlson.We do. CBS MarketWatch columnist Paul Farrell wondered if the slumphas already arrived, citing Ken Kurson's article ""Nine Signs We'reAlready in a Recession"" in Esquire's December issue. Kurson's thesismade sense and ""was worth the price of the magazine,"" but in the end,Farrell shrugged it off. ""Neither Esquire's Grinch nor the U.S.Supreme Court is going to steal my Christmas,"" he wrote. If only wecould face the doctor with such self-assurance. - Jen MuehlbauerUCLA Report's Economic Forecast: Recession Litehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730130UCLA's Anderson School Predicts 'Mild Recession' in 2001http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730131UCLA Economists See U.S. Recessionhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730132U.S. Recession Looming, Study Sayshttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730133Recession in 2001?

Sun CFOMichael Lehman did, but by the time he denied it, the stock hadalready taken a hit. ""These rumors have no basis in fact and arefalse,"" said Lehman in an indignant (and redundant) statement releasedon Monday.The rumor said ""a short-seller had published a compelling reportcharging accounting irregularities,"" explained TheStreet.com. Finerpoints were scarce, and that's probably just the way Sun spokespersonMark Paisley liked it. Since the gossip had no source or details,""That should tell you about the quality of the rumor,"" he toldReuters. After Lehman's official denial, Sun shares rebounded a bit inafter-hours trading, showing that some traders who believe rumors alsobelieve prepared corporate statements.Accounting scuttlebutt may have been the catalyst for Friday's Sunselloff, said TheStreet.com, ""But more notable was what thebook-cooking rumor obscured: a survey from small, Chicago researchshop Off The Record Research showing slowing sales of Sun servers toits distributors."" The Financial Times also noted analyst's worriesabout Sun sales, and Wall Street's concerns about Sun's ability tospar with HP, Compaq and IBM. Suddenly, everyone's in the server biz,and Sun's not looking so invincible anymore.Sun did get a bit of good press this week, by helping to form anindustry group to develop online audio and video standards. Thenagain, the group ""is sure to create a battle for market control with(media player companies) RealNetworks Inc. and Microsoft Corp,"" saidthe San Jose Mercury News.

Adult Web-site operators had suedNetwork Solutions because NSI, at the time the sole registrar ofdomain names, refused to issue names the AP characterized as""www.(pickanyobscenity).com."" (Last year, competing registries beganaccepting registrations for such names.) The judge ruled that domainnames are mainly about navigation, not about communicative speech. TheAP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internetexperts on possible reverberations from the case.The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won byan individual against an anonymous online poster. The Post's story, byBrian Krebs of Newsbytes, disentangled the complicated tale moreclearly than did CNET's AP copy. A U.S. District judge awarded$675,000 to an Emory University professor after an anonymous posteraccused him of taking kickbacks. The poster, unmasked in theinvestigation, was a former employee of the company he accused ofmaking the payoff. The Post provided the critical detail that thatcompany had fired the libeler. Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz, a policyanalyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology, for the bottomline: ""There's not much difference between saying slanderous thingsonline or offline. ... In terms of anonymity, it's probably mucheasier to send letters in the mail.""Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicitedcommercial e-mail. The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on arather typical spammer who had hijacked a company's computer to spreadmillions of spams offering porn and get-rich-quick schemes. Whatwasn't typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked downand arrested. He pleaded guilty to second-degree forgery and faces upto seven years in prison.Wired News and InternetNews assigned reporters to the other spam case,this one involving Web host Verio's use of ""whois"" customerinformation from Register.com in violation of the registrar'sacceptable-use policy. The case has not yet gone to trial, but afederal judge ordered Verio to stop using the whois data to barrageRegister.com's customers by e-mail, phone and mail. Writing forInternetNews, Clint Boulton detailed the judge's order and talked tooutside experts on the possible effects of the judge's order. Boultonquoted a Washington lawyer who emphasized the b-to-b aspect of thetussle: ""What this case does is go further in protecting therelationships a business has with its customers."" - Keith DawsonJudge Rules Against Profane Web Domains (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730141Professor Wins Net Libel Suithttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730142Doctor Awarded $675,000 in Net Libel Case (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730143Computer Hijacker Pleads Guiltyhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730144Verio's Alleged Spam Is Temporarily Cannedhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730145Judge Blocks Whois Spamhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730146/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\NEW PRODUCTS AND SEMINARS FROM HEWLETT PACKARDHewlett Packard's thinking ahead.

That's because a Wall Street analyst worked undercoverfor a day at one of the uber-bookseller's distribution centers andthen - what to our wondering eyes should appear - reiterated his ""buy""recommendation on Amazon's stock. It really is the season of miracles!According to the Financial Times, Credit Suisse First Boston analystJamie Kiggen put in a few hours working in Amazon's Delawaredistribution center and then penned this sunny conclusion: ""While ourpresence there suggests the hiring process could be tightened up abit, we were struck by the high level of energy and morale amongwarehouse management and workers alike."" Busy bees are happy bees.Kiggen's stint apparently didn't coincide with one of the six or soall-hands meetings that the New York Times reported Amazon heldrecently to, among other things, squelch unionizing efforts.You'd think journos might give extra scrutiny to Kiggen's dot-com gig,given the recent brouhaha over the New Yorker's similarly themed piecein its Nov. 27 issue. Writer Rodney Rothman was supposedly aiming forhumor, not analysis, when he wrote about his stint working for aSilicon Alley dot-com, according to coverage on the Web site MediaNews. But in a move that has left journos debating the merits ofundercover gigs, he neglected to tell the New Yorker that his motherworked for the firm he infiltrated. And that office massage he wroteso descriptively of? Never really got it. Literary license, you know.But outlets were glowing about Kiggen's undercover gig. CNNfn, whichbroke the ""news,"" speculated that Kiggen and the other CS First Bostonanalysts who cover Amazon ""may have set a new precedent this week forjust how far researchers will go to obtain information on a company.""The Financial Times enthused about Kiggen's ingenuity ""in an era wheninvestors often criticise analysts for being spoon-fed by thecompanies they cover."" And, boy, did Kiggen gather some terrificintelligence. According to the Financial Times, Kiggen's experience inthe Delaware warehouse, which handles as much as 25 percent ofAmazon's orders, ""suggested that the company was 'highly likely' tomeet or exceed fourth-quarter revenue estimates of $1 billion."" Allthis from an eight-hour stint! We guess we at Media Grok just don'tknow how to use our time as wisely.For his part, Kiggen could use a boost for his media profile. Hemissed being named to Fortune's ""all-star analysts"" team, but did getpegged for Business Week's piece on Net analysts' fall from grace.Business Week reported criticism of Kiggen's ""'lifetime value of acustomer' metrics used to justify his bullish Amazon calls"" andincluded the mention in a paragraph on ""voodoo valuation.""

When Gore's chances rise, themarket scowls. Friday was no exception. Around the time of the closingbell, the Florida Supreme Court ordered ""an immediate manual recount""of undervotes in all Florida counties. ""Stock index futures and someshares slumped"" according to CBS MarketWatch's Martin Cej and ChrisKraeuter.Saturday morning brought the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that stoppedthe recounts, and with it some sigh of relief from investors. TheSunday night press was uncharacteristically optimistic, looking forsigns that the uncertainty was close to ending. David Boies, formerMicrosoft slasher and Napster booster and now attorney for Gore, toldFox News that it could be ""the end of the road.""Bloomberg's Monday morning report from Tokyo went further, reportingthat U.S. stocks were up, Treasury bonds down as Bush was seen to bethe winner. ""It looks like we will know who the next president is,""Xinyi Lu, chief strategist at Tokai Bank, told Bloomberg. ""A Bushvictory is bad for bonds because it's good for stocks.''Whichever way it goes, it can't wrap up soon enough for financiers whodespise indecision. ""Until America learns how to run a democracy, themarket can go nowhere,"" said Robin Griffiths, chief technical analystat HSBC Securities on CBS MarketWatch.

Not a sure thing, but those aren't lotterynumbers, either.It's all academic now, at least for a few years. The Pentagon steppedin last week with an agreement to pay the $3 million each month ittakes to keep the constellation flying, at least for another twoyears. It signed the deal with Iridium Satellite, the company thattook over the assets of the original company when it filed forbankruptcy protection this year.Iridium was planned as a global phone system for jet-setters who needto stay in touch wherever their romps take them on the planet. But thecompany's expensive handsets (originally $3,000) and costly service(up to $7 per minute) doomed the service to all except those whoreally needed it - oil-rig crews, transoceanic yachstmen and CNNreporters. Everyone else found that GSM phones get you most of whatyou want for a fraction of the price.But it turns out the Pentagon has plenty of folks who need satellitephones, particularly in the Navy. Iridium ""will provide a commercialalternative to our purely military systems,"" Dave Oliver, principaldeputy under secretary of defense for acquisitions, technology andlogistics, told Reuters. There were other reasons, too. Reuters alsoreported that a U.S. interagency group was nervous about publicreaction to 74 satellites coming down in 14 months. The group wrotethat this ""might create widespread anxiety and lead to a public outcryfor ill-considered government action.""For $3 million per month, the Defense Department bought some time tofigure out what to do: In their current orbits, the satellites won'tfall to earth for about 108 years. By then, however, the danger may beeven worse. As Nicholas Johnson, NASA program manager for orbitaldebris, told Reuters, there will no doubt be more people on earth anda thus higher chance that one of them could get hit. - David SimsNASA: Satellite Odds of Hitting Someone 250-1 (Reuters)http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20001210/sc/tech_satellites_dc_2.htmlPentagon Signs Phone Deal With Iridiumhttp://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-4045594.htmlPentagon to Rescue Iridium (Reuters)http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,40600,00.html/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\NEW PRODUCTS AND SEMINARS FROM HEWLETT PACKARDHewlett Packard's thinking ahead.

No, the Other OneSome former Microsoft ""permatemps"" will have a little extra dough topay off their holiday Visa bills. Microsoft will pay about $97 millionto compensate 8,000 to 12,000 long-term temporary employees for thestock-purchase plan they never had.A spate of outlets ran the AP's coverage, including the allegationthat Microsoft's employment practices ""once allowed employees to beclassified as temporary for as long as 14 years."" (Temporary in theBuddhist, ""all is transitory"" way, we assume). The average assignmentwas 10 months, MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters. MS officialsalso insisted that many temps don't want to go on payroll, since theylike the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better. TheWashington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MStemps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired. Asfor the money, ""How many stories have you ever seen about high-techcontractors retiring at 35 because they made millions of dollars?"" aformer two-year temp asked the AP. ""If I had had access to whateveryone else had, I would be in the same financial situation as anumber of friends who are already retired,"" another former tempcomplained to TechWeb.Not that this is all about the bucks, some former permatemps said:Microsoft hurt their feelings. They ""had to wear orange badges, whileregular employees wore blue badges"" and couldn't go to office partiesor shop at the discounted company store, said the New York Times. Norcould they use the corporate health club, added the Washington Post'swriters, who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolicorange badges. ""This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side,""one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News. ""You weretrying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a second-classcitizen."" Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably wentthrough junior high.To get a better sense of the eight-year legal wrangling surroundingthis case, peruse the New York Times, the Washington Post and theSeattle Times. Basically, it comes down to this: Legal eagles say it'snot nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them intothe stock purchase plan, but temps are on their own for healthinsurance. Microsoft got the hint in the mid-'90s, told contractors totake at least 100 days off after sticking around for 12 months, letabout 3,000 employees trade their orange badges for blue ones, andhooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits. So maybe MStemps get that health insurance after all, but ""the company stilldoesn't give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at adiscount,"" said the Merc.Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to high-tech andthe business world in general, but the Seattle Times found acontrarian. ""One thing that has been noteworthy is there haven't beena large number of cases that have been filed (in the wake of theMicrosoft case),"" said the general counsel of the American StaffingAssociation. Nor will the case have ""a material impact on ourresults,"" said MS spokesman Matt Pilla.

As if wobbly tech companies weren'tenough to make everyone nervous, hackers have come out to play.In the ""clich,s come to life"" department, a hacker stole a database ofcredit card numbers from Creditcard.com and posted the numbers online.Creditcards.com, a b-to-b site that helps Web retailers accept creditcard payments, told ZDNet the hacker did his deed on Monday. Thecompany told MSNBC, however, that the suspect broke in four months agoand has been trying to extort Creditcards.com ever since. That wasn'tthe only communications mix-up: The firm never told its customersabout the breach. Creditcards.com also claimed that there was noevidence of credit card fraud, but MSNBC ""was able to find a potentialvictim within a few moments of seeing the database"" - an Illinoiswoman billed for $350 worth of WWF merchandise en route to thePhilippines. Here's a washcloth, Creditcards.com. You've got some eggon your face.In a less serious but equally embarrassing prank, a naughty photo ortwo appeared on the Web site of Japan's National Police Agency. ""Atthis point, nothing has been concluded, only that it was not caused bya virus,"" an NPA spokesperson told the AP. There's no evidence of abreak-in, said Japan's Daily Yomiuri, so maybe visitors were justredirected to a bogus site. Nobody can agree on what sorts ofrevealing photos were used, let alone the technical details.Worry about a hack attack at the University of Washington MedicalCenter - reported as early as Saturday in the Washington Post, SeattleTimes, and Wall Street Journal - ought to get new life from a piece inTuesday's USA Today. Not only can a successful hacker downloadconfidential medical information, said writer Greg Farrell, ""medicalrecords are a veritable treasure trove for those who would make thepatients victims of identity theft."" Yet another hazard of the U.S.health-care system.Finally, Business Week regaled its executive readership with tales ofembittered employees taking revenge via malicious hacking. ""Insiderhacking"" causes $1 billion in damage to U.S. businesses each year,said Business Week's Dennis Blank, and represents 70 percent of allattacks. Maybe Microsoft should be glad its disgruntled permatempsonly sued. - Jen MuehlbauerCreditCards.com Database Stolenhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734107Extortionist Targets Creditcards.comhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734108Hacker Puts Nude Photo on Japanese Police Web Site (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734109Hacker Modifies NPA-Operated Sitehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734110Medical Records Vulnerable to ID Thefthttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734111When the Hacker Is on the Insidehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734112/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\ARE YOU READY FOR KNOWLEDGE-BASED MARKETING?Primary Knowledge provides outsourced data warehousing and businessintelligence tools that help you focus on your most valuable customers.We aggregate isolated silos of online data, giving you a fuller pictureof your customers.

Al Goreis the most obvious choice to lead the disappointed, but techiescoming up short include Compaq and Razorfish (earnings warnings) andAsk Jeeves (layoffs). Then there are those wireless licenses, theauction of which produced a frenzy of interest and money in Europe butstateside are much more modest affairs, and that's a disappointmentfor the FCC.Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories, what with onlinesales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay. The high-priced bids onwireless licenses, however, seem to make the media's eyes glaze over.The Wall Street Journal reminded that wireless-license auctions raised$30 billion in the U.K. and $40 billion-plus in Germany. The U.S.auction, which kicked off Tuesday, is estimated to churn up a mere $15billion to $20 billion, and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst toldthe Journal that $12 billion sounds more likely.Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get what's going on.The Bloomberg posting on News.com helpfully explained that carriersare using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps incoverage, especially in major metropolitan areas. The Journal chimedin (eventually) that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef uptheir coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls. That'swhy, of the 422 licenses covering 195 local markets, the hottestaction was for hopping markets such as New York, Los Angeles andChicago. So far the total bids are up to $501.2 million after tworounds, the FCC told outlets. The highest bids have been $38.2 millioneach by Sprint and DCC PCS, a subsidiary of Dobson Communications, forlicenses in New York City. L.A. was runner-up, with Salmon and Verizonboth bidding $25.5 million for licenses in that market.The Financial Times blamed the absence ""of ruinously expensivespectrum auctions"" on this side of the Atlantic on ""the relativebackwardness of mobile telephony in the U.S."" The pricey auctions inEurope have been for fancy 3G wireless licenses, while the U.S. isstill peddling local markets. Expect ""a proper 3G auction"" to followhere in two years, the peach paper wrote. A jump in third-quarterchurn rates among telco companies signals that competition is startingto bite, the Lex Column warned. The high-priced ""auction risk""remains, Lex warned, but don't expect much.

TI Expands Cable Modem Offerings With an Integrated IEEE =802.11 Residential Gateway Platform=1DNew Design Leverages Technical Expert=ise in Wireless LAN and DOCSIS 1.1   DALLAS, Nov 27, 2001 /PRNewswire via C=OMTEX/ -- A new cable modem reference platform for broadband-enabled wirele=ss home networking is being introduced today by Texas Instruments Incorpora=ted (NYSE: TXN) (TI). The TNETC408 reference design incorporates TI's leadi=ng data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) 1.1 cable modem= technology with TI's 802.11b single-chip MAC/baseband processor to enable =the distribution of broadband content throughout the home. (See http://www.=ti/sc/cablemodem .)   ""Our certification success with DOCSIS 1.1 and techni=cal expertise in 802.11 made the development of a cable-enabled residential= gateway (RG) design a natural progression, allowing us to deliver cable mo=dem solutions that continue to extend our penetration in the market,"" said =Brett Butler, general manager of Cable Broadband Communications at TI. ""Con=sumers' desire for wireless home networking continues to grow, and this sol=ution allows us to help original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) bring more =affordable consumer products to market quickly.""   About the TNETC408 Resid=ential Gateway Solution   The TNETC408 RG solution offers a foundation for =cable providers to expand service offerings to and enhance management of ne=twork devices within the home through implementation of the CableLabs' Cabl=eHome(tm) initiative. TI is engaged with multiple third party software deve=lopers for support of the RG functionality that includes:   --  Firewall   =  --  Network Address Translation (NAT)     --  Dynamic Host Configuration =Protocol (DHCP) Client Server     --  Web based management  This RG referen=ce design builds upon TI's DOCSIS 1.1 silicon and software, and incorporate=s TI's TurboDOX(tm) software, which increases the upstream capacity and per=formance of the cable modem.   The TNETC408 incorporates TI's ACX100 802.11= single-chip MAC and baseband processor for wireless local area networks (W=LANs). The chip supports the 802.11b standard, commonly referred to as Wi-F=i, and offers a technology extension to increase the range of operation by =up to 70 percent. Additionally, the ACX100 offers 22Mbps extended data rate= capabilities today that are forward-compatible with elements of the new IE=EE 802.11g draft standard since the chip supports PBCC-22, for high-rate wi=reless networking in the 2.4GHz band. Combined with TI's robust cable modem= solution, TI's TNETC408 design will allow multimedia applications to be wi=relessly networked throughout the home.   About TI Broadband   For OEM's de=veloping broadband communications solutions, TI's advanced signal processin=g-based silicon and software platforms deliver the optimal performance, low=er power consumption, and system level integration required to rapidly depl=oy differentiated next generation products for cable modems, digital subscr=iber line (xDSL) modems, integrated access devices (IADs), Voice over Inter=net Protocol (VoIP) gateways, carrier infrastructure, and home and office w=ireless networking.

T=argeted to designers of analog, mixed-signal, memory and system-on-chip (SO=C) integrated circuits, HSIM provides detailed circuit-level analysis of ti=ming and power behavior, and signal integrity effects. This release deliver=s new analysis and device support along with enhanced interoperability with= other design tools.   ""I want to commend Nassda for producing such a produ=ct for the memory and mixed signal industry,"" said Puck Wong of Broadcom Co=rp. ""This is truly a significant and substantial development for mixed-sign=al circuit designers. Nassda's support for Broadcom also has been outstandi=ng. We are extremely happy with HSIM.""   ""HSIM version 1.3 further enhances= the accuracy, performance, device model support and nanometer analysis we =offer to designers,"" said Sang Wang, CEO of Nassda. ""Over 80 customers are =using our technology in their design flows. This commercial success has con=firmed our hierarchical approach to circuit analysis for analog, mixed-sign=al, memory and SOC designs. This technology will become even more widely ad=opted by the design community as they move into geometries at 180nm and bel=ow.""   HSIM Solves Critical Customer Issue  HSIM solves the critical issue =of analyzing circuit behavior while taking into account the electrical and =parasitic effects of nanometer scale silicon. Before the availability of HS=IM, design teams were unable to analyze these effects with a tool that had =the speed, accuracy, and capacity that was needed. In a recent benchmark, H=SIM verified a 50 million transistor network processor in just over 13 hour=s on a 32-bit workstation with 512Meg of RAM. HSIM's ability to address cri=tical verification issues is reflected in HSIM's dramatic rate of adoption =by design teams throughout the world.   HSIM Technology  Nassda created HSI=M to perform full-chip circuit simulation and analysis with accuracy within= 1-2% of SPICE but at speeds three to four orders of magnitude faster than =SPICE. HSIM uses a patent-pending hierarchical technology to deliver a capa=city of over one billion transistors, and is targeted to both pre- and post=-layout analysis of circuits.   ""HSIM version 1.3 further strengthens our l=eadership in full-chip nanometer circuit simulation and analysis with unpre=cedented performance and capacity,"" stated Dr. An-Chang Deng, President of =Nassda. ""HSIM's capability of annotating both layout parasitic and device g=eometry information to a pre-layout netlist is essential for efficient veri=fication and optimization of design implementations. HSIM enables first sil=icon success.""   New Device Models  HSIM now supports simulation of JFETs, =found in communication designs, using the same model found in SPICE simulat=ors. Another development for designers of high-speed systems is the ability= to analyze signal integrity effects with a lossy transmission line model. =As well, the latest MOS device model from U.C. Berkeley for nanometer-scale= devices, BSIM4, is now supported. The existing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) =device model has been improved in accuracy by working closely with Nassda's= customers. With each new release, HSIM continues to incorporate the latest= developments from industry and academic research.   Enhanced Netlist Back-=Annotation  HSIM version 1.3 provides enhanced support for the back-annotat=ion of parasitic RC data in DSPF format, and MOS device geometry informatio=n including device size, parasitics and resistivity. Since they account for= post-layout effects, back-annotation of DSPF and MOS device data is necess=ary for accurate analysis of signal integrity, and timing and power behavio=r.   New Spectral Analysis  With version 1.3, HSIM now provides spectral an=alysis by means of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Performed interactivel=y or after transient simulation, HSIM enables frequency analysis of communi=cation circuits. This new capability provides industry-standard windowing f=unctions for conditioning the analysis data as needed by designers.   Inter=operability  HSIM version 1.3 delivers improved interoperability with other= design tools by providing an application programming interface (API) for w=orking with customers' internal waveform viewers. The new release also prov=ides a user modeling interface (UMI) to integrate customer-proprietary devi=ce models.   Pricing and Availability  HSIM Version 1.3 is now available, a=nd is supported on workstations running Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Microsoft Windo=ws NT/2000, and Linux operating systems. U.S. prices start at $85,000.   Ab=out Nassda  Nassda Corporation (Santa Clara, California) develops and marke=ts full-chip nanometer circuit simulation and analysis solutions for advanc=ed IC designs, especially for analog, memory and mixed-signal systems-on-a-=chip designs. Nassda's HSIM product is the leading post-layout verification= and analysis tool for achieving first silicon success and improving produc=t quality and production yield.

(AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Monday announced Zambezi (S8710), an STS-1 cross=-connect grooming fabric designed for line card use.   Targeted for add/dro=p MUX systems, digital cross-connects and multi-service switches, this devi=ce is optimized to enable 10Gb/s, 20Gb/s, and 40Gb/s line cards to be built= with an integrated first and last, or Nth, stage grooming fabric. This sol=ution is capable of switching from the STS-1 level up to and including STS-=768c traffic, including arbitrarily concatenated traffic. Zambezi's single-=stage, non-blocking, switch architecture, easily enables broadcast and mult=icast configurations. In addition, the device offers an industry-leading lo=w power dissipation of 8W (typical).   Dual 768x768 (40Gb/s) logical-partit=ioning of the internal switch fabric and dual-casted IO interfaces allow a =single element to be used as the 1st and Nth stages of a larger, multi-stag=e, CLOS switch. Zambezi is unique in offering dual-casted I/Os, allowing fo=r seamless switching between the redundant core-stage switch elements. Sixt=een I/O ports can be dual-casted allowing this device to directly drive and= monitor redundant, core-stage switch elements. Zambezi can also be used st=and-alone or as the core stage element in a multi-stage fabric as a 1536 x =1536 (80Gb/S) fully non-blocking switch.   ""Zambezi is an extension of our =STS-1 switching capability previously demonstrated in our devices such as D=anube and Missouri,"" said Neal Neslusan, director of marketing at AMCC. ""Th=is is the first device which can be coupled with our next generation pointe=r processors for capability of supporting traffic up to OC-768c.""   The cro=ss-connect offers the capability to configure all of the I/Os to either 622=Mb/s or 2.5Gb/s on a per I/O basis. Many of the pointer processors availabl=e today that may interface to a device such as Zambezi, do not offer 2.5Gb/=s I/Os. Zambezi's dual-rate IO capabilities support a direct interface to t=hese pointer processor chips. This capability includes support of a direct =interface to AMCC's recently announced Mekong device. Customers may choose =to use Zambezi in conjunction with Mekong and S2509 for complete port densi=ty utilization of the Zambezi.   Pricing and Availability  Zambezi (S8710) =is offered in a 624-pin PBGA package and priced at $590.00 in volume quanti=ties. It is scheduled for sampling in October 2001 and volume production Q1= of 2002.

University of Dayton Selects Sybari's Antigen for Its Un=matchable Protection of Domino Servers Against E-mail Borne Viruses and Mal=icious Code=1DOne of Yahoo's Highest Ranking ""Most Wired"" Universities and =Ohio's Largest Private University Deploys Antigen for Proactive E-mail Secu=rity   E. NORTHPORT, N.Y., Nov 27, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Sybari Software,= Inc., the premier developers of Antigen, a comprehensive antivirus, conten=t-management, and e-mail security solution for Microsoft Exchange and Lotus= Domino environments, today announced that the University of Dayton (UD), w=hich was recently ranked No.16 of 200 colleges and universities who were ac=credited with the title of being one of Yahoo's Most Wired, has selected An=tigen for antivirus and security protection of their Lotus Notes/Domino ser=vers that support more than 10,000 students and nearly 2,000 faculty member=s and administrative and research personnel.   ""NIMDA,"" ""SIRCAM,"" ""LOVE,"" a=nd ""MELISSA"" have clearly demonstrated how crippling a virus can be in term=s of lost time, data, and productivity. The University of Dayton could not =afford to join the growing number of universities and large organizations t=hat have experienced the staggering costs of data recovery and downtime ass=ociated with these and other malicious viruses. After conducting a full eva=luation of server products from such companies as Trend Micro and McAfee, U=D concluded that a server-level solution offering multiple scan engines and= superior file filtering capabilities, coupled with a strong vendor commitm=ent to delivering a proactive line of defense from Internet and e-mail-born=e viruses, would provide the level of protection UD needs today and in the =future.   ""We selected Sybari's Antigen for many reasons including trusted =scanning, which means less processor time, the ability to quickly block any= files or file type, multiple scan engines, and the 24 x 7 uptime,"" said Su=san McCabe, Director, Lotus Integration for the University of Dayton. ""We d=on't need to take our servers down to apply updates. Antigen truly gives us= all of the features we feel are important and delivers the best value.""   =Sybari's Antigen is the only solution with a choice of up to five leading s=can engine technologies from: Network Associates, Norman Data Defense, Soph=os, and two Computer Associates engines from their Etrust offering. Since n=ew viruses may survive one engine, Antigen institutes an extra measure of p=rotection by enabling users to run multiple-scan engines, virtually elimina=ting network infection. Antigen comes equipped with Content Management faci=lities that provide the proactive support needed to maintain a virus free g=roupware environment. With the Antigen File Filter (AFF), administrators ca=n filter e-mail attachments by file name, type, or wild card. A pre-emptive= content management feature like this can prove extremely useful while wait=ing for signature files from anti-virus vendors with proprietary engines an=d virus labs.   ""We pioneered this industry with our flagship release of An=tigen for Lotus Notes/Domino environments in the nineties,"" said Rocco Donn=ino, vice president of sales, the Americas, for Sybari Software. ""Our lates=t release of Antigen further validates our commitment to developing highly =specialized solutions for messaging platforms and its selection by such a p=restigious university confirms our success in turning out winning solutions=.""   ABOUT SYBARI  Since 1995, Sybari has the led the market in providing i=nnovative solutions to groupware-based virus and security threats. Today, o=ver 5 million Microsoft Exchange/Outlook and Lotus Domino/Notes seats are v=irus-free as a direct result of Sybari's Antigen technology. Sybari's Antig=en is unsurpassed in providing protection of corporate messaging environmen=ts. Antigen's unique architecture institutes a preemptive line of defense f=rom viruses and malicious code. Antigen for Microsoft Exchange and Antigen =for Lotus Domino are distributed in more than 50 countries through Sybari's= worldwide locations and distribution network.

TI Introduces World's First 1.8V Logic Family for Portab=le Consumer Electronics, Telecommunications and Computing=1DFamily Extends =Battery Life, Simplifies Design Process, and Increases Data Throughput   DA=LLAS, Oct 19, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN)= (TI) today introduced a new logic family, Advanced Ultra-Low Voltage CMOS =(AUC) which are optimized at 1.8-V but are operational to sub 1-V levels. T=he AUC family provides significant benefits to portable consumer electronic=s, computing and telecom applications by operating at low power and high sp=eed while maintaining overall system signal integrity. (See www.ti.com/sc/a=uc )   The family consists of Little Logic (single/dual/triple gates), octa=ls and WideBus(tm) devices. All devices are optimized at 1.8-V, and have an= operating voltage range of 0.8-V to 2.5-V. With a voltage tolerance of 3.6=V, AUC extends the life of systems by allowing legacy devices to remain fun=ctional. In addition, the sub-1-V feature allows AUC to be operated by a si=ngle cell battery. AUC also includes Ioff, which protects the device by sup=porting partial power down applications.   TI has been working closely with= Philips and IDT to develop the specifications for the new AUC family. Init=ially, TI will release Little Logic and Philips will offer an alternate sou=rce. Subsequently, in 2002, IDT, Philips, and TI will release Octals and Wi=deBus devices. Based on this collaboration, alternate source agreements are= in place.   ""TI continues to take the logic market into new areas by devel=oping leading technologies and innovative products. The introduction of the= new AUC family enables customers to gain higher performance as they move t=o the lower voltage node DSPs and high-performance analog ICs,"" said David =Hoover, worldwide product marketing manager for TI's Standard Linear and Lo=gic Products. ""In addition, optimizing the family at 1.8-V extends battery =life while also speeding up data throughput in the system.""   Little Logic =AUC   The AUC family is available in single/dual/triple gate devices for po=rtable consumer electronics. Consistent with the family, the Little Logic A=UC devices are optimized at 1.8-V, while maintaining high speed and low noi=se. Essential to the success of portable consumer applications, the devices= extend battery life while maintaining very good signal integrity. The Litt=le Logic devices will be available in various packaging options, including =NanoStar(tm) packaging, the world's smallest logic package.   ""Philips' foc=us on providing leading Pico Gate solutions for the consumer, networking, a=nd communications markets makes the alternate source agreement for AUC tech=nology a perfect match,"" said Bruce Potvin, director of marketing logic pro=ducts. ""Working with TI, we are able to deliver a true alternate source for= AUC Little Logic devices that offer high-performance, industry leading sol=utions.""   Widebus/Octal AUC   For telecommunications and computing applica=tions, the AUC family of devices offer high speed data throughput and enhan=ced signal integrity that is critical to performance. Speed for the Widebus= devices is a very fast, 1.5ns- 2.0ns (typical). The 1.8-V provides a logic= migration for lower operating voltages, and simplifies the system design l=earning curve.   ""The AUC family enhances IDT's high-performance low voltag=e logic portfolio by enabling us to keep pace with the industry, as custome=rs migrate to lower operating nodes,"" said Kevin Walsh, director of strateg=ic marketing for IDT's Timing and Logic Division. ""As a company strongly fo=cused on communications, we believe it is important to use our digital desi=gn expertise to be a leader in product innovation. By collaborating with TI= and others, we ensure that these next-generation devices will provide the =necessary performance, nodes of operation, and feature set for our networki=ng and communications customer base.""   Availability, Packaging and Pricing=   The first Little Logic devices in the AUC family are sampling now with v=olume production scheduled for the first quarter of 2002. Estimated resale =pricing for the Little Logic devices begins at $0.18 for quantities greater= than 1,000. Devices in Little Logic are available in NanoStar packaging, S=C-70 (DCK), and SOT23 (DBV). AUC NanoStar will be available in 1H 2002. Wid=eBus and Octal devices are available in 2Q02. The AUC family is fully suppo=rted with technical documentation.

The new device suppor=ts the capture of still images at up to 3-megapixels in less than a second,= and it encodes and decodes CIF resolution (352x288) MPEG-4 I+P frame video= at 20 frames per second (fps). Additional power-down modes provide a reduc=tion in overall system power consumption and prolonged battery life. The en=hanced DSP subsystem enables higher imaging and video processing performanc=e, while the preview engine, the addition of an external host interface and= SD, Multi-media Card (MMC) and Memory Stick interfaces all make the DSC25 =a more flexible solution for digital cameras, dual-purpose PC cameras and o=ther multimedia applications.   ""The introduction of the DSC25 illustrates =TI's commitment to the fast- growing digital imaging market,"" said Will Str=auss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts. ""The price, perfo=rmance and programmability are very attractive features, but the ability to= also handle Internet audio functions in addition to the flexible imaging c=apability expands its utility and overall value to the camera manufacturer.=""   The DSC25 is manufactured using a 0.15-micron (SIA) CMOS process that i=mproves speed and lowers power consumption over the DSC21. Combining TI's l=ow power TMS320C54x(TM) DSP with an ARM7TDMI(R) RISC processor on a single =device provides programming flexibility that allows developers to offer uni=que features in new systems, upgrade existing designs as standards evolve a=nd create new products from existing hardware platforms by modifying softwa=re. Additionally, DSP programmability enables system developers to leverage= their investment in hardware and software to get to market quickly and cos=t- effectively with new products.   ""TI has learned from the success of the= DSC21 what customers need most for next-generation digital cameras,"" said =Dr. Raj Talluri, Imaging business manager at Texas Instruments. ""The increa=sed performance, programming flexibility and low power consumption of the D=SC25 will enable manufacturers to offer consumers higher quality images and= a greater range of features in upcoming digital camera products.""   Additi=onal enhanced features of the DSC25 include a digital liquid crystal displa=y (LCD) interface and S-video output. An enhanced on screen display (OSD) p=rovides more flexible, simplified graphical user interface (GUI) developmen=t for system designers with dedicated video, bitmap and cursor windows. An =improved preview engine enhances preview quality with faster memory access =and image resizing. Direct memory access (DMA) to external dynamic random a=ccess memory (DRAM) and an external host interface enhance flexibility for =PC-related applications.   TI's support features serve to make system devel=opment easier and speed time to market. Software modules will be available =for all major video- imaging compression standards, including JPEG, motion-=JPEG, MPEG, MPEG-4, H.263, as well as audio standards such as MP3 and Advan=ced Audio Coding (AAC), as well as data communication standards such as USB= and RS-232. In addition, the DSC25 is supported by TI's eXpressDSP(TM) Rea=l-Time Software Technology, which includes the Code Composer Studio(TM) int=egrated development environment (IDE), the DSP/BIOS(TM) real-time kernel, t=he TMS320(TM) DSP Algorithm Standard for interoperability and reuse and the= industry's largest base of third-party software modules.   Pricing and Ava=ilability   Samples of TI's DSC25 DSP solution are available now, with volu=me production currently scheduled for Spring 2002. Evaluation modules (EVMs=) are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2002 to help camera =OEMs begin development on new systems. The DSC25 solution in quantities of =100 thousand units or more is expected to be less than $20 each.

Integrating previously d=eveloped, Bluetooth-compliant radio and baseband components onto a single h=igh-performance integrated circuit, the chip minimizes component counts and= board space requirements while providing a high-performance solution to th=e Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity challenges faced by equipment= manufacturers.   The Blutonium(TM) BCM2033 achieves the highest performanc=e of any single-chip Bluetooth transceiver in the industry, combining Bluet=ooth-qualified radio and baseband circuits onto a single monolithic chip. O=n-board Fractional-N synthesizer technology allows the chip to work with pr=actically any reference frequency available. This is especially useful in c=urrent and third generation (3G) cellular phones in which a wide variety of= crystal oscillators are available. Featuring high levels of integration an=d minimal off-chip filters or other active components, the BCM2033 provides= excellent performance in the presence of radio interferers and is ideally =suited for harsh radio frequency (RF) environments, such as inside mobile p=hones and laptop computers. In addition, the chip's unique design allows it= to maintain its high performance even across the extended temperature rang=e of between -40 and +105 degrees centigrade, an accomplishment unparallele=d in the industry.   ""With our previously announced Blutonium products, we =demonstrated our unique ability to achieve outstanding radio performance de=signing chips in a standard digital CMOS process,"" said K.C. Murphy, Vice P=resident and General Manager of Broadcom's RF and Advanced Mixed Signal Bus=iness Unit. ""We've now applied Broadcom's well-known integration expertise =by combining RF and digital circuits onto a single substrate while maintain=ing unmatched performance among Bluetooth transceivers. As a result, we're =unveiling the single-chip Bluetooth transceiver the industry has been waiti=ng for, with performance exceeding that of practically any other solution, =regardless of the process technology.""   The BCM2033 is based upon Broadcom='s previous all-CMOS stand-alone radios and basebands that have already ach=ieved Bluetooth Version 1.1 qualification and which exceed the Bluetooth sp=ecification in most areas. This means that devices such as mobile phones an=d PC cards built using Blutonium components are compatible with the latest =version of the Bluetooth specification, easing the process by which these d=evices can apply the Bluetooth logo to their products. The BCM2033 benefits= from this previous development, achieving strong performance in key areas =such as linearity and receiver sensitivity, attaining a sensitivity figure =of better than -82 dBm.   Integration of the previously developed circuits =onto a single chip was made possible because the entire Blutonium line, lik=e all Broadcom chip products, was developed in a standard digital CMOS (or =Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) manufacturing process. No other pr=ocess allows the combination of RF and digital circuits on a single transce=iver.   ""By first proving our radio and baseband architectures in CMOS with= standalone products, we've chosen to emphasize performance in our Bluetoot=h component development program,"" said Scott Bibaud, Director of Marketing =for Broadcom's Bluetooth Products. ""With these multiple Blutonium elements =integrated onto a single cost-effective chip, we can now leverage Broadcom'=s proven reputation for operational excellence and provide these components= in production quantities to our customers around the world.""   Key Feature=s  The BCM2033 has been designed to provide very high performance in Blueto=oth applications with a single transceiver. Notable features include:   -- = Strong spurious emissions performance -- the BCM2033 minimizes     interfe=rence from transmissions taking place in the bands used by     mobile phone=s, providing robust connections between Bluetooth     devices.  --  Excepti=onal blocking performance -- the highly linear design     eliminates the ne=ed for costly off-chip RF filtering to receive     reliable signals from ot=her Bluetooth devices.  --  Fractional-N Synthesizer -- this synthesizer en=ables the 2033 to     use any existing frequency reference, including those= commonly     available in mobile phones such as CDMA, WCDMA, GSM, GPRS, an=d     UMTS, eliminating the need for an off-chip crystal.  --  Extensive so=ftware support -- the BCM2033 is software-compatible     with protocol stac=ks developed by leading third party stack     vendors, as well as with Broa=dcom's internal stack.  --  Cost-effective memory architecture -- on-chip m=emory eliminates     the need for off-chip flash while allowing the use of =additional     memory when appropriate.  --  Requires minimal off-chip comp=onents -- by eliminating all     external active components, the BCM2033 re=quires just a few     passive components, providing very limited bill of ma=terials (BOM)     and board space impact on OEM equipment designs.     Avai=lability  The version of the BCM2033 with no external memory bus is package=d in a 64-pin fine pitch Ball Grid Array (fpBGA) and the version with exter=nal flash interfaces is packaged in a 100-pin fpBGA. The transceiver is sam=pling now to early access customers.

New TI Chipset Leverages OMAP(TM) 710 GSM/GPRS System-on=-a-Chip for Next-Generation Wireless Data and Voice=1DTI Delivers Industry'=s Most Complete Smart Phone Chipset Reference Design   DALLAS, Oct 24, 2001= /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- The broad market availability of 2.5G mobile sm=art phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) will receive a significan=t boost today, thanks to a new highly-integrated chipset offering from Texa=s Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) that delivers voice and enhance=d data. The new chipset provides wireless device manufacturers with a compl=ete ""antenna-to-applications"" solution and reference design for enabling op=timal performance and power savings for 2.5G mobile devices. TI's OMAP(TM) =platform technology lies at the heart of the chipset and is the first proce=ssor to integrate a GSM/GPRS modem and a dedicated applications processor o=n a single chip that supports next-generation, bandwidth-intensive wireless= applications. (See http://www.ti.com/sc/TCS2500 )   The programmable digit=al signal processor (DSP)-based TCS2500 chipset leverages the OMAP710 proce=ssor to enable services such as multimedia messaging, short video clip and =Internet audio downloads, e-mail, real-time Web browsing and games. Buildin=g on the benefits of TI's TCS2100 GPRS chipset announced in June 2001, the =new TCS2500 chipset combines the OMAP710 processor with TI's leading analog= baseband and RF technology to offer a comprehensive silicon and software o=ffering. Tailored specifically for 2.5G smart phone and PDA devices, the TC=S2500 chipset adds to TI's growing family of GPRS solutions.   ""The TCS2500= chipset is an integral part of TI's strategy to provide powerfully integra=ted solutions that speed time-to-market for our OEM customers,"" said Jean-L=uc Villevieille, general manager of TI's wireless chipset solutions. ""With =the TCS2500 offerings, wireless designers will benefit from TI's 10 years o=f wireless expertise plus our OMAP platform, which has already been selecte=d by a wide variety of manufacturers as the de facto standard for 2.5 and 3=G devices.""   TI Chipsets Provide Significant Advantages for Wireless Indus=try   Wireless device manufacturers can significantly reduce cost and form =factors over current smart phones and PDA implementations due to the integr=ation in the TCS2500 chipset. At the same time, the chipset allows new syst=ems to maintain low power and performance comparable to today's voice- cent=ric 2G wireless phones. Also important for wireless device manufacturers, T=I's TCS2500 solutions includes the key building blocks for quickly and easi=ly developing 2.5G devices: a GSM/GPRS digital baseband processor, which in=cludes dedicated applications functionality, analog baseband and RF compani=on chips, plus complete software solutions including protocol stacks.   At =the core of the solution is TI's OMAP710 processor that incorporates a DSP-=based GSM/GPRS digital baseband engine and an ARM9 microprocessor with inte=grated MMU and cache for complete modem and applications support. As part o=f TI's OMAP family of flexible, open processors, the OMAP710 features full =support of advanced mobile operating systems such as Microsoft's Windows CE=, PalmOS, Symbian OS and Linux(R). In addition, the OMAP710 provides Java p=rogramming support and gives wireless device manufacturers access to a netw=ork of application developers who are actively creating applications for th=e OMAP platform.   The OMAP710 processor is code compatible with TI's OMAP1=510 processor and other future OMAP wireless products. This allows designer=s building products on one processor to quickly and easily port code to ano=ther, saving significant engineering resources for manufacturers.   Other d=evices in the TCS2500 chipset include the TWL3012 analog baseband and the T=RF6150 RF IC. The TWL3012 combines voiceband and baseband codecs with singl=e and multi-slot IQ RF interfaces, and auxiliary RF converters into a highl=y integrated device. The TRF6150 is a highly integrated RF IC based on an a=dvanced direct conversion architecture, yielding bill of materials (BOM) re=ductions of about 30 percent versus competitive super heterodyne architectu=res.   Complete 2.5G Wireless Smart Phone Reference Design Reduces Time to =Market   The TCS2500 chipset includes a full array of software development =tools as well as a complete OMAP710-based reference design that together ca=n reduce development time by more than half a year. The reference design in=cludes the complete BOM, board design and layout, a fully type-approved ref=erence design, best-in-class and worldwide customer support and access to a= complete GSM/GPRS Layer 1, 2 and 3 stack. The reference design is a comple=te 2.5G wireless system solution that is ready to be manufactured and put i=nto final plastics.   The TCS2500 chipset is sampling to customers today an=d will begin shipping before the end of 2001.

However, Charles F. Boucher semiconductors analyst at Bear= Stearns feels TXN's near-term outlook is somewhat weaker than expected.  T=he analyst highlights the fact that gross margins were slightly below the a=nalyst's estimate at 25%, and operating expenses were also lower than the a=nalyst's model. According to the analyst total sales are expected to declin=e 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter due to a normal seasonal decline, =and chip sales are expected to decline by about 5% sequentially.  Boucher i=s reducing his 2001 EPS estimate for the company from $0.10 to $0.09, and 2=002 EPS from $0.08 to ($0.04), as well as 2003 EPS from $0.80 to $0.70.  De=spite the analyst's disappointment Boucher made the following comment,  ""Ou=r disappointment with deeper near term losses is tempered by solidifying ev=idence of a fundamental turn in semiconductor bookings?

Seehttp://www.ti.com/sc/aap6372u.The high-performance XTR108 allows for digital calibration of sensor andtransmitter errors via a standard digital serial interface, eliminatingexpensive potentiometers or circuit value changes. Calibration settings can= bestored in an inexpensive external EEPROM for easy retrieval during routineoperation.Digitally-controlled adjustments dramatically reduce manufacturing costs an=dallow companies to build a single sensor design to serve a wide range of ne=eds.Individual units can be stocked and later programmed and reprogrammed for a=ny ofhundreds of possible end-customer specifications (special temperature range=s,etc.). Sensors can also be reprogrammed in the field, if necessary.""By allowing the user to digitally adjust the gain, offset and linearity of= theanalog output, the XTR108 eliminates the need for manual trimming ofpotentiometers and the costs associated with this process,"" said John Brown=,strategic marketing engineer for TI's High-Performance Linear products.""Furthermore, among the very few similar ICs on the market, the XTR108 prov=idesmore versatile multi-channel input and excitation multiplexing.""The XTR108's wide programmable gain amplifier (PGA) range allows full- scal=einputs from 5 to 320mV. The all-analog signal path contains a built-insub-regulator, voltage reference, input multiplexer, autozeroed PGA, dualprogrammable current-sources, linearization circuit, internal oscillator,control logic, and an output current amplifier.Current sources directed through the multiplexer can be used to excite RTDtemperature sensors, pressure bridges, or other types of transducers. TheXTR108's uncommitted op amp can be used to convert current into a voltage, =orfor four-wire RTD circuits.Functionally, a 4-20mA transmitter provides accurate transmission of analogsignals from sensors (used to monitor physical parameters in industrialprocesses such as temperature and pressure) to remotely located measurementequipment. The sensor signal is amplified, linearized, and transmitted in t=heform of current with no power supply required at the transmitter site. 4-20=mAcurrent loops are not affected by line resistance and are much more immune =toelectrical interference.Available TodayThe XTR108 is available now and is packaged in an SSOP-24. Suggested resalepricing is $3.45 in 1,000 piece quantities. The device is specified for -40degrees Celsius to +85 degrees Celsius temperature range.Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=singand analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age.

QUALCOMM and KTFreeTel Reach Agreement to Commercially =Launch BREW-Enabled Handsets and Services to Customers in November 2001=1DA=greement Announced at PT/Wireless & Networks Comm Beijing 2001, Leading Kor=ean Carrier is First in the World to Launch BREW Service   BEIJING, Oct 24,= 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), pioneer and =world leader of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital wireless techn=ology, and KTFreeTel, a leading Korean wireless carrier, today announced at= the PT/Wireless & Networks Comm Beijing 2001 conference that the companies= have reached an agreement for the commercial launch of KTFreeTel's applica=tions service based on QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless(T=M) (BREW(TM)) platform. KTFreeTel expects to roll out its BREW-enabled magi=c n multipack(TM) service to subscribers on their third-generation (3G) CDM=A2000 1X network beginning November 1, 2001. KTFreeTel will be the first ca=rrier in the world to launch BREW platform services and provide customers w=ith the ability to download wireless applications over the air -- anytime, =anywhere.   ""KTFreeTel's commitment to QUALCOMM's BREW platform represents =a bold advancement toward the future of useful wireless data services,"" sai=d Peggy Johnson, president of QUALCOMM Internet Services, the division of Q=UALCOMM responsible for the complete BREW solution. ""KTFreeTel's customer f=ocus, combined with QUALCOMM's technology leadership, takes full advantage =of the improved capabilities of today's mobile devices to bring truly relev=ant, useful solutions to market. For the first time, people will be able to= choose the applications and features they want, and the BREW platform's ab=ility to download applications over the air is the breakthrough that enable=s this.""   The agreement was announced at a ceremony featuring Dr. Joo Youn=g Song, senior vice president, KTFreeTel Multimedia Business Division and P=eggy Johnson.   ""This agreement with QUALCOMM further enhances KTFreeTel's =technology leadership and market strategy,"" said Dr. Song. ""We've created a= much-needed solution that will put the power to personalize cell phone ser=vices, over the air, directly in the hands of consumers.""   KTFreeTel condu=cted a successful public user trial of the BREW-enabled magic n multipack s=ervice with 5,000 users in September and October 2001. The BREW-enabled ser=vice allows KTFreeTel subscribers to easily download and install a variety =of applications in a matter of seconds. For KTFreeTel's customers, this mea=ns that the same BREW-enabled handset hardware can provide very different c=apabilities tailored to individual interests as subscribers download the ap=plications they want from various categories, such as games and entertainme=nt, business applications, messaging and navigation services. More than 160= applications are currently available from more than 20 companies, includin=g Anicom, Gaeasoft, GeoTel and Lycos-Javagame.   KTFreeTel's BREW services =will launch on two new CDMA2000 1X BREW-enabled handsets:   --  LG Electron=ics' CX300 phone features a 256-color display, a         clamshell design a=nd dual LCD screen.     --  Samsung's SPH-X2500 phone has a color display, =a clamshell         design and features Samsung's melody maker that uses a =        16-chord progression.  Details of the business agreement between QU=ALCOMM and KTFreeTel were not disclosed.   QUALCOMM's BREW platform is a th=in, standardized execution environment that resides in handsets. Native BRE=W applications are written in C/C++. While the BREW platform supports progr=amming in other languages, such as Java, C/C++ is used as a primary languag=e by significantly more developers worldwide than any other language, accor=ding to International Data Corp. QUALCOMM's BREW initiative is the only app=roach that offers developers, OEMs and carriers a complete, end-to-end solu=tion for wireless applications development, device configuration, applicati=on distribution, and billing and payment. The complete BREW solution includ=es the BREW Software Development Kit(TM) (SDK) for developers, the BREW app=lication platform and porting tools for device manufacturers, and the BREW =Distribution System (BDS) that enables developers and their carrier custome=rs to get applications to market and coordinates the billing and payment pr=ocesses for them. Carriers' BREW services will enable consumers to customiz=e their handsets by downloading applications over the air from a carrier's =application download server.

Applied Micro Circuits Corporation Announces Stock Opti=on Exchange Program   SAN DIEGO, Oct 18, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Ap=plied Micro Circuits Corporation (Nasdaq: AMCC) today announced that it wil=l be offering a voluntary stock option exchange program to its employees, o=fficers and board members.   Under the program, which is expected to commen=ce before the end of October 2001, participants will be able to tender for =cancellation stock options that have an exercise price equal to or greater =than $20 per share for replacement options to be issued on a date which is =at least six months plus one day from the date of cancellation of the tende=red options. The exercise price of the replacement options will be equal to= 100 percent of the market price of AMCC stock on the grant date of these o=ptions. The terms and conditions of the replacement options, including the =vesting schedules, will be substantially the same as the terms and conditio=ns of the cancelled options.   ""Our most important assets are our employees=. Equity, in the form of options, has been a major employee motivator and a=s such, a significant contributor to our success in the past,"" Dave Rickey,= Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said. ""In light of the decline in the= price of our common stock, we recognize that the exercise prices of the ma=jority of outstanding options to purchase our common stock, whether or not =they are currently exercisable, are higher than the price of our common sto=ck. We believe these options are less valuable as an incentive to retain an=d motivate employees. By making this offer to exchange options, we intend t=o provide our employees with the benefit of holding options that over time =may have a greater potential to increase in value, and thereby create bette=r incentives for our employees to remain with us and contribute to the atta=inment of our future business and financial objectives and the creation of =value for all of our stockholders.""

""Mekong's a=bility to re-map section and line overhead or transparently pass-thru all T=OH (Transport Overhead) bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes), with pointer p=rocessing enabled, on incoming SONET/SDH signals enables intelligent optica=l networking equipment to provide performance monitoring and support switch=ing/routing decisions on incoming fibers. This can all be done while provid=ing full transparent processing of client interfaces over private DWDM netw=orks and public networks,"" said Mark Donovan, AMCC's Mekong senior product =marketing manager. ""By designing the device to interface seamlessly with AM=CC's popular OC-48 transceiver and OC-192 SERDES and 10G digital wrapper/FE=C solutions, we're further contributing to the company's overall system sol=ution approach and reducing our customer's time-to-market.""   Mekong also s=upports a variety of line interfaces for reducing system and board design r=equirements. For OC-48 interfaces Mekong supports 4-bit wide 622 Mbits/s in=terfaces, to enable seamless connections to AMCC's S3455 SERDES device. For= OC-192 applications, Mekong provides 16-bit 622 Mbits/s interfaces for sea=mless connections to AMCC's 16-bit S3097/98 SERDES devices. Mekong's OC-192= interfaces are also designed for direct connection to AMCC's 10G digital w=rapper/FEC Hudson device.   Mekong is AMCC's next generation framer/pointer= processor device that enables the aggregation of four OC-48s into a larger= OC-192 signal, or if used in conjunction with AMCC's Danube framer/pointer= processor device, the aggregation of up to sixty-four OC-3s, sixteen OC-12=s or logical combinations of OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48 asynchronous interfaces =into a larger OC-192 signal (See figures 2 and 3). Mekong provides standard= SONET/SDH pointer processing, and in addition, can transparently re-map th=e incoming OC-48 and OC-192 signals TOH across time domains and into the ou=tgoing higher rate signal. Mekong also supports a pass-thru mode, where all= TOH bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes) can be passed through Mekong, with= pointer processing enabled, to enable full transparency across time domain=s. As a result, when AMCC's Danube is used in conjunction with Mekong, opti=cal networking equipment vendors can offer service providers full transpare=ncy from OC-3 to OC-192 rates. Mekong can also perform the same functions i=n an OC-192-to-OC-192 mode.   Enabled by the device's two APS ports, Mekong= provides protection switching and redundancy in both the multiplex and dem=ultiplex directions and incorporates non-intrusive TOH monitoring for all i=nputs. The single-chip device features two built-in hitless Time Slot Inter=change switches (TSIs), to provide STS-1 level traffic grooming, cross-conn=ection, and add/drop applications. When used in conjunctions with AMCC's re=cently announced Zambezi, an 80G STS-1 level switch fabric device, the Meko=ng/Zambezi solution can serve as the first and Nth stage switch elements in= a N-stage Clos switch fabric architecture (See figure 4). Mekong also offe=rs a provisional pointer processor bypass mode for STS-192-to-STS-192 opera=tion (through-timing); both a full framer bypass (no frame regeneration) as= well as a pointer processor bypass (frame regeneration enabled) are also p=rovided. Mekong also supports large deksew buffers in the multiplex directi=on for STS-192c inverse multiplexing applications. A high-speed microproces=sor interface is provided for configuration and monitoring. Mekong also sup=ports POH (B3/J1/G1/C2) monitoring, Full TOH drop and insert ports and robu=st alarm monitoring functions to provide the highest in OC-192 SONET/SDH in=tegration and functionality for optical and DWDM equipment.   ""Mekong's fea=ture-rich architecture and flexibility allows for multiple use in DWDM, Met=ro DWDM, digital cross-connects, multi-service access switches and core swi=tch platforms,"" said Neal Neslusan, AMCC's marketing director of transport =products. ""It is well suited for Optical-Electrical-Optical (OEO) switching= applications where grooming wavelengths from the optical network and suppo=rting electrical SONET/SDH signal switching is required.""   Pricing and Ava=ilability  The Mekong (S19204) is scheduled for sampling to development par=tners in August, with volume production scheduled for Q4 2001. Packaged in =a 624 CBGA, the device is priced at $775.00 in volume quantities.

Macy's and Yahoo! Announce Finalists of 'Go to the Head= of the Parade' National Campaign=1DAmerican Public to Begin Voting to Send= One Lucky Kid to the 75th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade(TM) R=ibbon-Cutting Ceremony   NEW YORK & SUNNYVALE, Calif., Oct 23, 2001 (BUSINE=SS WIRE) -- Macy's, in association with Yahoo!(R) Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), today= announces the three finalists of Macy's ""Go To The Head of The Parade"" nat=ional campaign -- Kevin Connors, of Holmdel, N.J., Brent Paucke of Williams=port, Pa. and Savannah Stewart of Warden, Ill. -- and invites the American =public to vote on http://macysparade.yahoo.com for the student they feel ha=s best made a contribution to their community or school. From over 3,000 en=tries received, these three finalists reflect the best of American youth. V=oting will begin on Tuesday, October 23rd and run through Wednesday, Octobe=r 31st.   The Go to The Head of The Parade national campaign was introduced= in celebration of this year's historic 75th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgivin=g Day Parade(TM) to recognize the contributions of America's youth. The cam=paign, begun September 2, 2001, asked Americans across the country to submi=t nominations of students, in essay form, via mail or online via Yahoo!, hi=ghlighting their good deed for the community or school. This first-of-its-k=ind program had teachers as well as civic, community and religious leaders =submit a 150-word essay nominating a student they felt had made a real diff=erence in their school or community; something significant enough to allow =them to ""Go To The Head Of The Parade."" The campaign was open to middle or =high school students within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The= finalists are:   Savannah Stewart, 12 years old, of Worden, Ill., nominate=d by Deanna Regnier for her selflessness in making a difference for familie=s in her community that are less fortunate. For the past five years, Savann=ah has been supplying local pantries with food for Thanksgiving, as well as= helping clothe neighborhood children with warm coats and shoes during the =winter. As if her caring and community service were not enough, Savannah th=rows herself a birthday party and donates all the presents to needy childre=n.   Kevin Connors, 17 years old, of Holmdel, N.J., nominated by March of D=imes coordinator Joanne Procopio, for his fundraising efforts for the March= of Dimes and for actively raising awareness on the importance of healthy l=ifestyles. Kevin has raised over $40,000 for the March of Dimes to help sav=e babies lives in 2001. At the age of five, Kevin experienced the death of =his cousin due to a heart defect, and since then, has shared his experience= with others and has been committed to saving babies. Recognized as the Num=ber One March of Dimes Youth Fundraiser, Kevin has raised over $88,000 in t=he past five years.   Brent Paucke, 15 years old, of Williamsport, Pa., nom=inated by Joseph Hurley, a friend of the family, because of the courage tha=t Brent demonstrated in a time of crisis. One day at Bishop Neuman High Sch=ool, Brent and his classmates had finished attending a service for the vict=ims of the San Diego High School shooting. After the priest had said that n=othing like that would ever happen in their school in Williamsport, Pa., it= did. An eighth grade girl pulled a loaded pistol out of her backpack and s=tarted yelling. Her gun went off and hit a girl in the shoulder. While ever=yone was trying to find cover, Brent calmly talked the girl into dropping t=he gun, then kicked it away, averting further catastrophe. For his heroic a=ctions, Brent has garnered media attention, but most important of all, the =safety of his classmates and himself.   At the culmination of this campaign=, one special child will have the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of participatin=g in the traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Par=ade, officially starting the 75th annual trek down Broadway -- live on nati=onal TV! In addition to the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the child and his or h=er family will receive airfare and hotel accommodations for four, as well a=s VIP viewing of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Broadcast live on NBC on N=ovember 22nd, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will get the holiday season st=arted in grand style!   Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade marks its 75th Anniv=ersary this year, making it the longest running show on Broadway. Started i=n 1924 as Macy's Christmas Parade, the Parade has grown in size and scope t=hrough its remarkable 75-year history, becoming an American holiday traditi=on, which has touched millions of lives around the world. With its high-fly=ing fun, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which has been broadcast live for =half a century on NBC, has been in step with the times, showcasing popular =culture and closing the generation gap. From its humble beginnings with mor=e than 400 employees to its legendary line-up of more than 8,000 strong, th=e Parade has become a part of our lives as it has echoed the spirit of the =holiday season. The Parade is produced by Macy's East, which is a subsidiar=y of Federated Department Stores, operating 117 stores in 15 states along t=he East Coast.   About Yahoo! Inc.  Yahoo!

AMCC's 10 Gbps Network Processor to Complete Industry's= First Scalable, Software-Compatible 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps NPU Family=1DFourt=h-Generation nP7510 Network Processor Joins AMCC's nPX5700 and nPX5800 to C=omplete 10 Gbps Network Processor, Traffic Manager, and Switch Fabric Platf=orm   SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 22, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circu=its Corp.'s Switching and Network Processing Group (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) tod=ay announced the nP7510 10 Gbps Network Processor, which is expected to com=plete the industry's first software-compatible network processor (NPU) fami=ly that scales from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps, from Fast Ethernet and OC-3 to 10 =Gbps Ethernet and OC-192 Packet over SONET (PoS) and ATM applications.   Th=e nP7510 represents the fourth generation in the company's nP7000 family of= fully software-programmable, policy-enabled network processors, and with t=he nPsoft(TM) Development Environment, customers can easily preserve their =investments in software from previous generations. The nP7510 complements A=MCC's previously announced 10 Gbps traffic managers, framers, PHYs, and swi=tch fabrics to form the industry's first complete integrated solutions for =10 Gbps rate metropolitan area (MAN) edge, access, core router, and other a=pplications. Designed with the company's core, patented Network-optimized I=nstruction Set Computing (NISC) technology, the nP7510 achieves 10 Gbps rat=es using just six of AMCC's own highly efficient nPcores(TM) and readily av=ailable .18-micron CMOS technology, reserving smaller process geometries fo=r future enhancements and multi-component integration. The maximum efficien=cy of AMCC's core NPU technology allows for even greater potential future s=caling to 40 Gbps OC-768 rates.   ""AMCC is a market and technology leader i=n the network processor industry,"" said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst o=f The Linley Group. ""The nP7510 gives the company a significant lead over i=ts major competitors in delivering a 10 Gbps product. In addition, AMCC's c=ombination of compatible 10 Gbps network processor, traffic manager, framer=, PHY, and switch fabric components lets designers reduce time-to-market an=d risk.""   The nP7510 represents the fourth-generation of AMCC's nP7000 fam=ily of fully software-programmable, policy-enabled network processors and i=s capable of wire-speed processing at 10 Gbps rates. The network processor =offers enhanced debugging capabilities and minimized intrusiveness over pre=vious generations with its On-Chip Debug Engine, allowing programmers incre=ased visibility and flexibility when debugging code. The nP7510 features a =new optimized memory interface for the six patented, highly efficient nPcor=es(TM), enabling new savings in internal memory space. The device also supp=orts a greater number of simultaneous tasks, or threads, than prior network= processor generations. The nP7510 is complemented by AMCC's nPsoft(TM) Dev=elopment Environment, including C/C++ compiler, assembler, performance prof=iling utilities, graphical symbolic debugger, the nPsoft Services framework= and API, and the core nPkernel layer that ensures developers can easily pr=eserve software investments from prior generations. Ready-to-use switching,= IP routing, MPLS, and ATM application libraries from AMCC and its software= partners provide even greater options for fully integrated turnkey solutio=ns.   ""Our field-proven, now fourth generation core technology not only let=s us produce a wire-speed OC-192 NPU, but enables a complete scalable famil=y, from OC-3 to potential future OC-768 line rates, without a major archite=ctural overhaul,"" said Andy Gottlieb, vice president of marketing for AMCC'=s Switching and Network Processing Group. ""AMCC's scalable core technology =and complementary software architecture make possible new highly scalable c=omplete network equipment systems products with a wide range of interface a=nd uplink speeds, and our existing customers can leverage their prior softw=are investments to further reduce both risk and time-to-market.""   While th=e nP7510 can be used in a variety of configurations, including easy combina=tion with other vendors or customers' own silicon, the nP7510 further demon=strates AMCC's leadership in providing complete high-bandwidth silicon solu=tions for intelligent optical networks by combining seamlessly with AMCC's =complete family of 10 Gbps solutions. These include Khatanga, AMCC's recent=ly announced OC-192 framer, the nPX5700 feature-rich traffic management chi=pset, and AMCC's nPX5800 and nPX8000 families of multi-technology IP/ATM sw=itch fabric solutions that scale from 20 Gbps to terabit ranges.   Pricing =and Availability  The nP7510 is packaged in a 1428-pin Flip Chip BGA and is= expected to begin sampling in January. It is priced at $700.00 in volume q=uantities of 10K.

J.D. Power and Associates and Yahoo! Inc=. Report: Travelers Strongly Prefer Federal Involvement in Airport Security= Screening Process   AGOURA HILLS, Calif., Nov 19, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- =As the busiest holiday travel period approaches, consumers are still planni=ng to increase air travel. Last week's crash of Flight 587 did not dramatic=ally reduce confidence in air travel, however, travelers want more federal =involvement in security measures, according to the J.D. Power and Associate=s and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) report released today.   Among those who ha=ve traveled within the last three months, 62 percent of air travelers say t=hey are ""already comfortable"" with air travel. This same group reports the =level of travelers reporting they will ""never"" be comfortable rose from 3 p=ercent to 5 percent.   The report shows being ""afraid to fly"" is still the =most often-cited reason for curtailing air travel plans, with nearly 50 per=cent of leisure travelers mentioning it as their number one reason. One-thi=rd of business travelers cited either economic conditions or company restri=ctions on air travel as their top reasons for not flying.   Travelers have =a strong preference for federal involvement in the airport security screeni=ng process, according to the report.   ""The highly publicized recent storie=s of security lapses have greatly reduced the public's opinion of private a=irport security companies,"" said Michael Taylor, director of travel service=s at J.D. Power and Associates. ""The public also feels stronger that a sear=ch of checked baggage is necessary for airport security.""   One thing that =hasn't changed in the past month is the public's faith in technology to pro=vide greater security. High-tech scanners and bomb ""sniffers"" top the list =of items travelers would like to see in airports. A ban on restaurant cutle=ry and national ID cards have the least impact on how safe consumers feel. =  ""As for what can be done to increase in-flight security, armored cockpit =doors would inspire as much confidence as sky marshals posted on random fli=ghts,"" said Taylor.   The percentage of people that feel air travel has ""ch=anged forever"" is slowly dropping, while the percentage of people perceivin=g ""no difference"" increased from 8 percent to 12 percent. The Flight 587 tr=agedy did not affect the percentage of travelers who are still undecided ab=out their comfort level in flying, which remained steady at one in five tra=velers.   The survey was conducted two months after the worst air catastrop=hes in the history of the United States, September 11, and one day after th=e crash of Flight 587. J.D. Power and Associates and Yahoo! collected data =from more than 2,600 adult respondents. The public opinion poll was conduct=ed among random visitors to Yahoo's Web site the week of November 12. More =than 1,200 of the respondents reported having air travel experiences within= the past three months.   Headquartered in Agoura Hills, Calif., J.D.

The Verrazano facilit=ates the development of SONET/SDH compliant serial backplanes, saving syste=m developers up to 25 percent of a system's total bandwidth that would othe=rwise be lost with 8B/10B encoding schemes. Running 27-1 PRBS data on all c=hannels, the device features an ultra-low transmit jitter generation of 36 =picoseconds peak-to-peak (typical) and provides outstanding eye diagram cha=racteristics with a 91 percent eye opening allowing for increased reach con=nections at ultra low error rates. (See figure 1).   System developers bene=fit from the Verrazano's SONET/SDH compliance and compatibility with AMCC's= industry-leading Mekong and Zambezi framing and switching devices. By inte=rfacing with AMCC's Hudson Digital Wrapper device, the Verrazano provides t=he only complete solution for a mid-plane based Digital Wrapper design. (Se=e figure 2). Very Short Reach OC-192 applications utilize the Verrazano's c=ompatibility with AMCC's S7022 and S7025 parallel fiber components. This ma=kes the company's VSR solution ideal for system developers needing plug-n-p=lay VSR links up to 300 meters for rack-to-rack and chassis-to-chassis inte=rconnections as well as board-to-board optical backplane connectivity found= in large terabit systems.   ""The Verrazano is the industry's first 10 Gbps= Digital Wrapper SERDES supporting the ITU G.709 standard while combining e=xcellent jitter generation specifications with improved bandwidth efficienc=y,"" said Jon Siann, director of marketing at AMCC. ""By delivering complete =and intelligent connectivity devices to our customers, AMCC demonstrates it=s commitment to providing total system solutions for the next generation of= optical networks and the terabit connectivity market.""   Manufactured in l=ow cost CMOS technology, the device features a power consumption of 5.2 W t=ypical and runs from 1.8 V and 2.5 V power supplies. The Verrazano supports= FEC encoded and non-FEC encoded Digital Wrapper frames and provides Optica=l Channel Overhead insert and drop and Digital Wrapper BIP-8 monitoring for= improved signal integrity. Performance monitoring features including SONET=/SDH B1 and Digital Wrapper BIP-8 monitoring, Out Of Frame (OOF), Lock Dete=ct and FIFO Over/Underflow provide link integrity monitoring in conjunction= with signal integrity enhancement features, which include differential CML= high-speed I/O, on-chip terminations, programmable output swing, redundant= output drivers with individual squelch control and passive equalization; a=ll of which extend the life of existing low-cost backplane designs.   TDM t=ransport systems can upgrade existing backplanes from OC-12 rates to OC-48 =rates across the backplane by utilizing the signal integrity and link monit=oring. The device also supports OC-192c inverse muxing with full transparen=cy allowing DWDM network operators to maintain proprietary in-band messagin=g.   Pricing and Availability  The Verrazano (S2509) is currently sampling =to development partners with volume production scheduled for Q3 2001. Packa=ged in a 483-pin FCPBGA, the device is priced at $360 in volume quantities.=   About AMCC  AMCC designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-perfo=rmance, high-bandwidth silicon solutions for the world's optical networks. =AMCC utilizes a combination of high-frequency analog, mixed-signal and digi=tal design expertise coupled with system-level knowledge and multiple silic=on process technologies to offer integrated circuit products that enable th=e transport of voice and data over fiber optic networks.

(AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Wednesday announced the demonstration of a complet=e very short reach (VSR) OC-192 Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CW=DM) link exhibited in booth No. 8460 at SuperComm 2001 in Atlanta.   The co=mplete VSR OC-192 link is based on the utilization of AMCC's Ganges (S19202=) OC-192 framer/mapper, Verrazano (S2509) Digital Wrapper/FEC transceiver d=evice, and Blaze Network Products' Afterburner-XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM transceive=r optical module, which incorporates AMCC's S7022 and S7025 PMD devices. Th=e S2509 and Afterburner module are implemented on a reference design with a=n OC-192 300-pin MSA compliant I/O interface for backwards compatibility wi=th existing 10 Gbps long-reach OC-192 solutions. This single-fiber VCSEL-ba=sed module technology is ideally suited for inter-box short-reach OC-192 co=nnectivity in Central Offices and Data Centers.   ""This complete OC-192 lin=k is a very compelling low cost alternative to longer-reach solutions that =are less economical for distances less than 300 meters,"" said Paul Duran, A=MCC's product marketing manager. ""This demonstration exemplifies AMCC's com=mitment to provide the most cost effective, pre-engineered solutions for ou=r OEM customers.""   ""Our customers do not have the time to work out the sys=tem issues related to performance and interfaces between components in the =link,"" said Bill Wiedemann, Blaze Network Product's vice president of sales= and marketing. ""We choose AMCC's S7022 VCSEL Driver and S7025 TIA/Post-Amp= for our CWDM module because they were designed to work in concert with oth=er AMCC components for a complete framer-to-fiber VSR OC-192 link.""   The B=laze Afterburner-XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM module is currently in production. For m=ore information on this product visit www.blazenp.com.

OpenVoB Successfully Completes CallFests =III & IV; Participating Vendors Recognized for Superior Effort and Equipmen=t=1DAvail Networks, Broadcom, General Bandwidth, Intel, Ishoni Networks, Me=taSwitch, Texas Instruments and Xavi Test Standards-Based Deployment Models= for Interoperable Voice Over Broadband Services   RICHARDSON, Texas, Nov 1=9, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OpenVoB(tm), the industry consortium dedicated t=o accelerating the deployment of Voice-over-Broadband (www.openvob.org), to=day announced the success of the group's third and fourth CallFests(tm), mu=lti-vendor interoperability test events held Oct. 7-15 and Nov. 12-16, 2001=, at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory in Durham,= N.H.   These CallFests focused on interoperability between multiple voice =gateway and integrated access devices (IADs) based on the ATM Forum's Loop =Emulation Services (LES) voice over AAL2 specification. The testing was don=e to address provisioning and management of the IADs based on the ATM Forum='s recently released LES EOC/MIB specification.   CallFests form a critical= step in the mass deployment of voice over broadband services. Testing of t=he LES EOC/MIB specification will ultimately enable service providers to su=pport flow through provisioning of new services.   In a network able to sup=port flow-through provisioning, an order is entered by a customer service r=epresentative on the top-most system, and it ""flows through"" all other inte=rmediate systems, finally affecting the configuration of the network to set= up an end-to-end circuit. Provisioning is automated, reducing costs and er=rors. Flow-through provisioning ensures that the cost of provisioning a der=ived voice line will not be higher than the costs of a POTS circuit nor as =error prone as manual provisioning.   ""CallFest III and IV were largely suc=cessful because of the dedication and commitment shown by the members and e=quipment vendors that were present,"" stated Paul Drew, OpenVoB Technical Ed=itor and Interoperability manager. ""We are enthusiastic about the progress =that we have made and look forward to future CallFests and assisting the st=andards bodies in advancing the roll-out of voice over broadband technology=.""   OpenVoB is working with the University of New Hampshire's InterOperabi=lity Laboratory to establish an on-going interoperability testing network w=ithin their labs which has been made possible through the generous support =of leading access network and testing vendors including Cisco Systems (Ligh=tStream 1010 ATM Switch), Avail Networks (Frontera 2200 SHDSL Access Switch=), Sage Instruments (935AT Voice Quality Tester), Malden Electronics (DSLA =Speech Performance Measurement System), RADCOM (ATM Protocol Analyzer) and =Spirent Communications (Abacus Class 5 Switch Simulator).   The end product= of the OpenVoB CallFest series is a set of validated implementation models= and corresponding test plans that will be submitted to the appropriate sta=ndards bodies to help accelerate the adoption and deployment of voice over =broadband technology and services.   If you are interested in participating= in upcoming CallFests or becoming a member of OpenVoB, please send an e-ma=il to info@openvob.org.   About OpenVoB  OpenVoB (or Open Voice over Broadb=and) was formed to meet the expressed needs of service providers planning t=o deploy voice over broadband services by facilitating multi-vendor, system=-level interoperability of packetized voice services based on existing and =emerging industry specifications. The group leverages a cooperative enginee=ring approach to create deployment models and test plans that enable and pr=omote the development of interoperable gateways, IADs, softswitches and oth=er VoB products from multiple vendors.

SpotLife Announces Agreement with Yahoo! Mail; Create, S=end and View Video E-mail through Yahoo! Mail   SAN MATEO, Calif., Nov 26, =2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SpotLife, the leading provider of integrated person=al video solutions, and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global communi=cations, commerce and media company, today announced an agreement to offer =users video e-mail services through Yahoo!(R) Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).= The addition of video e-mail services will enable users of Yahoo! Mail to =easily create and send personalized video e-mail messages to friends, famil=y and colleagues virtually anywhere in the world.   ""SpotLife's technology =provides a significant value-add to the Yahoo! Mail service,"" said John Wal=sh, CEO of SpotLife. ""Video e-mail offers Yahoo! the ability to provide the=ir users with easy and reliable video e-mail capabilities, while ensuring t=hat Yahoo! Mail maintains a superior service offering, and the best Interne=t video technology available on the market.""   Under the agreement, SpotLif=e will provide video e-mail technology and service for Yahoo! Mail. The ser=vice enables Yahoo! Mail users to easily record video with a PC video camer=a, or upload video already existing on their PC. SpotLife's technology auto=matically compresses and uploads video messages to SpotLife's servers, elim=inating the need to store large digital video/audio files on the end-users'= PC. Recipients of a video e-mail receive a notification message containing= a link to a Web page on Yahoo! Mail where the customer can readily view th=e video through the SpotLife Player. The videos are composed and sent direc=tly from a Yahoo Mail user's existing account, and managed and stored by Sp=otLife. Whether consumers are using broadband or dial-up connections, the v=ideo e-mail service works with any Internet connection speed.

Semiconductor Sector Fails To Break Through Resistance -= Commentary Part 2     (RealTimeTraders.com) - Wednesday we alerted readers= the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index was testing an important resis=tance level. After being unable to break through this resistance level over= the past 4 sessions, the index steadily pulled back on Wednesday and close=d at the worst level of the day. On the session the index lost 34 points or= 7.4% and closed at 428.  Given that a slew of semiconductor related compan=ies including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Texas Instruments (TXN) repo=rted negative earnings after the close on Wednesday should further pressure= this index on Thursday. Another stock to watch on the downside within this= sector is Micron Technology (MU). According to a Dataquest, Inc. report, D=RAM revenues are once again expected to decline in 2002. In 2001 DRAM reven=ues are expected to drop by 67%, and in 2002 DRAM revenues are expected to =drop another 19%. Since Micron Technology's main product line is in the DRA=M arena, it could come under some pressure.  Copyright(c) 2001 RealTimeTrad=ers.com, Inc.

(AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) and Zarlink Semiconductor(TM) (formerly Mitel Semic=onductor) today announced they are developing multi-channel, interoperable =10 Gigabit per second (Gbps) per channel products that will offer customers= complete short-reach optical connectivity solutions for high-capacity, nex=t-generation networking systems.   Zarlink will introduce 12-channel, VCSEL=-based parallel fiber modules operating at 10 Gbps per channel, for an aggr=egate bandwidth of 120 Gbps. AMCC will bring to market interoperable physic=al layer, switch fabric, network processing and framer products. The intero=perability of AMCC's components and Zarlink's 10 Gbps per channel modules w=ill enable optical systems vendors to quadruple equipment capacity, while r=educing development cycles and time to market.   Zarlink expects the market= for very short-reach parallel fiber solutions used in and between high-cap=acity network equipment to grow beyond US $1 billion within three years. Th=e companies' new 10 Gbps parallel fiber products meet customer requirements= for lower cost and higher speeds by offering four times the bandwidth dens=ity of today's 2.5 Gbps short-reach optical systems.   ""This is the next st=ep in our program to develop a family of very short-reach, high-capacity pa=rallel fiber modules that deliver the industry's best price-performance rat=io,"" said Claes Johansson, director of Zarlink's Optical Communications uni=t. ""Developing modules that transport data at 120 Gbps is made possible by =continuing advances in our 10 Gbps VCSEL and patented packaging and manufac=turing technologies.""   Collaborative work on the new 10 Gbps products foll=ows a successful joint program to develop short-reach optical solutions ope=rating at 2.5 Gbps per channel. Zarlink's current generation of 4-, 8- and =12-channel modules utilize AMCC's S7022 Quad VCSEL driver and S7025 Quad tr=ansimpedance amplifier (TIA), with integrated limiting amplifier and Loss o=f Signal (LOS) detection circuitry.   ""We will continue to build on our suc=cessful relationship with Zarlink for complete terabit connectivity solutio=ns that complement our PHY, framer/mapper, network processor, and switch fa=bric products for seamless distributed networking systems,"" said Paul Duran=, AMCC's product marketing manager. ""This compelling technology is an essen=tial ingredient in the development of terabit networking systems that requi=re the lowest cost and power dissipation per gigabit as well the highest ba=ndwidth density per square inch.""   Target applications for the new product=s include proprietary interconnects in high-capacity scalable multi-chassis= routers, switches and optical cross-connects; and standardized interconnec=ts between this type of equipment in central offices. For example, the comb=ination of Zarlink's 10 Gbps per channel parallel fiber modules with AMCC's= PHY/framer products will enable a complete and cost-effective 40 Gbps tran=sponder solution for Very Short Reach (VSR) OC-768, compliant with proposed= Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) standards.

Texas Instruments May Come Under Pressure - Future Does =Not Look Good     (RealTimeTraders.com) - Wednesday after the close Texas I=nstruments reported earnings that top estimates by $0.01. Analysts on the a=verage expected the company to report a loss of $0.04 the latest earnings c=ame in at a loss of $0.03.  The problem with this picture is the future out=look. According to the comments from Texas Instruments decline in semicondu=ctor sales is expected to bottom in the fourth quarter. Despite the optimis=m the company failed to say when it will return to profitability.  It is al=so worth pointing out that Texas is expecting to report a loss of $0.06 for= the fourth quarter. According to First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 20= brokers had expected the company to to lose only a penny.  We at RealTimeT=raders believe it is important to highlight that the company is expecting t=o register a sequential revenue loss of 10%. We believe this may also press=ure the stock. We strongly suggest readers watch the analysts comments and =rating/earnings estimate changes.  Technical analyst point out that the sto=ck recently bounced off the long term support around $20-22 area. Given the= negative outlook and the market volatility may lead potential retest aroun=d mid-September levels. Copyright(c) 2001 RealTimeTraders.com, Inc.

The high-performance XTR108 allows for digitalcalibration of sensor and transmitter errors via a standard digital serialinterface, eliminating expensive potentiometers or circuit value changes.Calibration settings can be stored in an inexpensive external EEPROM for ea=syretrieval during routing operation. See http://www.ti.com/sc/aapxxxxu.Digitally-controlled adjustments dramatically reduce manufacturing costs an=dallow companies to build a single sensor design to serve a wide range of ne=eds.Individual units can be stocked and later programmed and reprogrammed for a=ny ofhundreds of possible end-customer specifications (special temperature range=s,etc.). Sensors can also be reprogrammed in the field, if necessary.""By allowing the user to digitally adjust the gain, offset and linearity of= theanalog output, the XTR108 eliminates the need for manual trimming ofpotentiometers and the costs associated with this process,"" said John Brown=,strategic marketing engineer for TI's High-Performance Linear products.""Furthermore, among the very few similar ICs on the market, the XTR108 prov=idesmore versatile multi-channel input and excitation multiplexing.""Functionally, a 4-20mA transmitter provides accurate transmission of analogsignals from sensors (used to monitor physical parameters in industrialprocesses such as temperature and pressure) to remotely located measurementequipment. The sensor signal is amplified, linearized, and transmitted in t=heform of current (no power supply required at the transmitter site). 4-20mAcurrent loops are not affected by line resistance and are much more immune =toelectrical interference.The XTR108's wide programmable gain amplifier (PGA) range allows full scaleinputs from 5 to 320mV. The all-analog signal path contains a built-insub-regulator, voltage reference, input multiplexer, autozeroed PGA, dualprogrammable current-sources, linearization circuit, internal oscillator,control logic, and an output current amplifier.Current sources directed through the multiplexer can be used to excite RTDtemperature sensors, pressure bridges, or other types of transducers. TheXTR108's uncommitted op amp can be used to convert current into a voltage, =orfor four-wire RTD circuits.Available TodayThe XTR108 is available now and is packaged in an SSOP-24. It is priced fro=m$3.45 in 1,000 piece quantities. The device is specified for -40 degrees Ce=lsiusto +85 degrees Celsius temperature range.Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=singand analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age.

The new chip, the ACX100, is comprised of an integrated =Media Access Controller (MAC) and baseband processor, combined with on-chip= PCI, CardBus and USB interfaces, thus eliminating the need for external br=idging components. The chip supports both the CCK (Complementary Code Keyin=g) and newer Packet Binary Convolutional Code(TM) of the current IEEE 802.1=1b standard. With PBCC(TM) modulation, end-to-end solutions using TI's ACX1=00 offer a coding gain advantage of 3dB over current CCK-only 802.11b solut=ions, allowing for the 70 percent coverage area improvement.   Since it uti=lizes an embedded microprocessor for implementing much of the MAC layer pro=tocol, the ACX100 is firmware upgradable, which facilitates support of evol=ving IEEE standards such as the forthcoming 802.11e (quality of service) an=d 802.11i (security enhancements). The device is fully compatible with the =IEEE 802.11b standard and also supports a 22Mbit/sec high rate mode that do=ubles the throughput over today's existing 802.11b networks.   ""By offering= cost optimized reference designs and a new generation technology that can =enable a sub $80 retail price for better performing PC cards, TI's ACX100 w=ill help increase wireless LAN penetration in homes and offices,"" said Alle=n Nogee, senior analyst at Cahners In-Stat Group. ""The extended range achie=vable by the ACX100 will also impact the growth of wireless networking in t=he home environment since consumers will now be able to easily experience b=roadband Internet sharing through a single access point, which has not been= always the case today.""   Complete Reference Designs Speed Time to Market =  To help manufacturers achieve a faster time to market, TI is offering thr=ee reference designs using the ACX100 for PC Card, mini-PCI and USB applica=tions. The reference designs include a complete hardware development kit (H=DK), which reduces engineering resource requirements by providing schematic=s, layout, Gerber files and bill of material requirements. These same refer=ence designs also support the 22Mbit/sec high rate extension.   Network dri=ver interface specification (NDIS) 4/5 drivers, including configuration and= site survey tools, that are Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Hardware Quality Labs =(WHQL) certified are also included. TI expects to take each reference desig=n through WECA certification of Wi-Fi interoperability to further improve t=ime-to-market for customers. To prepare for the fall arrival of Windows XP,= TI is also developing NDIS 5.1 drivers required for this platform. WHQL ce=rtified Windows XP drivers for the ACX100 are scheduled to be available by =4Q01.   The ACX100 was also designed with considerations for access point d=evelopment. Leveraging a 32-bit PCI/CardBus or 16-bit slave interface, the =ACX100 can easily connect to a network processor to provide a highly effect=ive solution for access points. TI has created an ACX100 driver development= kit (DDK) offering an easy way for developers to create customized drivers= often required for access point applications.   ""TI strongly believes that= 802.11 will reshape the Local Area Networking landscape,"" said Marc Cetto,= general manager of TI's Home Networking Business Unit. ""With our new ACX10=0 solution we will be able to drive wireless networking into more broadband= homes, offices and public places by offering a solution with extended reac=h and range at the right price point for more consumers to adopt the techno=logy. We will continue adding technology enhancements while targeting syste=m cost discontinuities for all our forthcoming wireless LAN products ""   Av=ailability   ACX100 based reference designs are available today. Production= shipments of customers' systems based upon the ACX100 are expected in 4Q01=.

New Report Analyzes How to Succeed in the Integrated Op=tics Business With Bookham Technology and Lightwave Microsystems as Example=s   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct 23, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Communica=tions Industry Researchers, Inc. (CIR), a leading market research and indus=try analyst firm, announces a new report that analyzes key success factors =in the market for integrated optical components and shows how two relativel=y small companies -- Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham Technology -- have =been able to emerge as leaders in this business along with giants Agere, Al=catel, JDS Uniphase and Nortel. This new report considers the managerial, t=echnological, marketing and financial aspects of these two companies' penet=ration of the optical integration marketplace.   Why Integrated Optics is a= Big Boy's Business   CIR believes that, for the time being at least, becau=se manufacturing know-how is so much a part of the secret sauce of integrat=ed optical components companies, these companies must typically own their o=wn plants. Factories cost ""big bucks"" -- and CIR believes that it takes $10=0 million in resources to be a player in the optical integration game. As a= result, the market for integrated optics is going to be dominated by the l=argest component manufacturers, especially Agere, Alcatel, JDS Uniphase and= Nortel.   Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham Technology are two smaller co=mpanies that are focused on optical integration and both have crossed the $=100 million funding barrier by a substantial margin. The new CIR report sta=tes that Lightwave Microsystems' initial success has been largely due to ch=arismatic leadership while Bookham's can be traced to its close initial rel=ationship with Nortel. However, the current photonic ""nuclear winter"" means= that the stability of both companies' customer bases is uncertain. Orders =from the largest equipment companies have declined rapidly and many equipme=nt start-ups seem likely to disappear in a massive shakeout in the next yea=r. The good news for Bookham investors is that Bookham currently gets most =of its business from Lucent, Nortel, Fujitsu and Marconi and despite their =current woes, these companies are most likely to survive the downturn. Alth=ough it does not reveal customer information, Lightwave Microsystems also a=ppears to be focusing its efforts on making inroads with the largest equipm=ent companies and CIR research indicates that it has already achieved a sig=nificant mindshare with these customers.   More Ambition Needed?   CIR beli=eves that if Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham are to continue to be succe=ssful, they will have to be ""more ambitious"" in seeking competitive advanta=ge in their core technologies and integrated product strategies.   Lightwav=e Microsystems is using a version of silica-on-silicon integration technolo=gy. However, the new CIR report notes that this approach is being used by m=any other companies and so offers no long-term competitive advantage to thi=s company. Indeed, the new CIR report provides evidence that the silica-on-=silicon processes may have significant technical limitations, which may act=ually restrict Lightwave Microsystems opportunities in the future. And, whi=le acknowledging that Bookham's all-silicon approach may have more long-ter=m potential, the report also says that both companies' product road maps fo=r integrated optical products have been somewhat timid -- they both appear =to be focused on offering combinations of a MUX/DEMUX and Variable Optical =Attenuator. The report points out that the market for such products is quit=e limited. It says that if the integrated optics market is ever going to ta=ke off, all companies operating in this space are going to have to make goo=d on their currently vague promises of more exciting integrated optics prod=ucts with additional functionality and cost/performance improvements.   The= report concludes with an analysis of Bookham's and Lightwave Microsystems'= future prospects and strategic options, including the possibility that the=y may be acquired.

Broadcom's qualified components i=nclude a full suite of radio and baseband chips, as well as Link Manager Pr=otocol (LMP) firmware, providing end-to-end enabling technology for a range= of Bluetooth applications. This means that devices developed using Broadco=m's Blutonium(TM) chips and firmware can attain Bluetooth qualification wit=h minimal effort, accelerating the time-to-market for these products.   ""Ou=r Blutonium line provides our customers with unmatched flexibility in the d=evelopment of their pre-qualified Bluetooth products,"" said Scott Bibaud, D=irector of Bluetooth Marketing for Broadcom. ""With multiple Bluetooth-quali=fied basebands and radios, as well as a qualified LMP, Broadcom can provide= equipment developers with the solution that's right for their application.=""   The Blutonium line consists of two standalone all-CMOS Bluetooth radios=, the Broadcom(R) BCM2001 for general applications and the BCM2002X, a radi=o-only chip optimized for use in mobile phones. In addition, the family inc=ludes two baseband processor chips, the BCM2039 standalone baseband and the= BCM2019 host-based baseband chip that includes no on-board processor and i=nstead leverages the processor of its host device. Broadcom's LMP firmware =stack provides the processor logic that manages connections between Bluetoo=th devices.   ""One of the benefits of Bluetooth is the ability to allow man=y different types of data devices to share information over the air,"" Bibau=d said. ""As a result, no `one-size-fits-all' solution can truly accommodate= the breadth of applications created by this technology. We've developed th=e Blutonium line to include a variety of Bluetooth-qualified silicon and sy=stem solutions to enable whatever applications our customers dream up, prov=iding functionality optimized for their product needs and getting those pro=ducts through the qualification process and to the market in short order."" =  With high receiver sensitivity and excellent blocking performance, the Bl=utonium product line is ideally suited to perform well in harsh radio frequ=ency (RF) environments such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers or= in geographical areas with high concentrations of radio interference. Blut=onium supports the complete Bluetooth 1.1 feature set, including full data =rate, seven slave piconet with master/slave switching, and scatternet. Manu=factured in a standard digital CMOS process, the Blutonium line features hi=gh levels of integration, incorporating all RF circuits on-chip and requiri=ng very few external passive components, which reduces system cost and boar=d space requirements.   Qualifications of the BCM2001 and BCM2002 were perf=ormed by Hyper Corporation, a Bluetooth Qualification Body (BQB) in Pleasan=ton, California, while qualifications of the BCM2019 and BCM2039 were perfo=rmed by 7 Layers, a BQB located in Irvine, California. The qualification pr=ocess consisted of testing of the baseband chips and LMP firmware, as well =as some radio testing by the BQBs, and verification of test data against sp=ecifications set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). In accordan=ce with these procedures, Hyper and 7 Layers performed testing and reviewed= Broadcom's test results, verifying compliance of the transceivers and ensu=ring that products using the chips will be eligible to bear the Bluetooth l=ogo. The Broadcom transceivers were qualified with no waivers.   About Broa=dcom  Broadcom Corporation is the leading provider of highly integrated sil=icon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice=, video and data services. Using proprietary technologies and advanced desi=gn methodologies, Broadcom designs, develops and supplies complete system-o=n-a-chip solutions and related applications for digital cable set-top boxes= and cable modems, high-speed local, metropolitan and wide area and optical= networks, home networking, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), carrier ac=cess, residential broadband gateways, direct broadcast satellite and terres=trial digital broadcast, digital subscriber lines (xDSL), wireless communic=ations, System I/O(TM) server solutions and network processing.

In a paper entitled ""Sequential Color Recapture and =Dynamic Filtering: A Method of Scrolling Color"" authored by D. Scott Dewald=, Steven M. Penn and Michael Davis of Texas Instruments, an innovative appr=oach to increasing the efficiency of a single modulator display is describe=d.   ""The current DLP single-panel technology has only one color present on= the surface of the DMD, meaning that, at any one time, one third of the li=ght is used while two thirds of the light is wasted,"" said Scott Dewald of =TI's DLP(TM) Products division, who delivered the paper at the conference. =""Sequential Color Recapture - SCR - is a technology that allows all three c=olors to be present simultaneously, such that a single panel DLP system can= now be as efficient as - potentially more efficient than - a three panel s=ystem, but without the additional parts, size, weight and expense of three =panel systems.""   ""Although many solutions have been proposed to the challe=nge of maximizing the efficiency of single modulator displays,"" he continue=d, ""all have exhibited a high degree of mechanical complexity which would m=ake manufacturability a real issue. One of the key virtues of SCR is its si=mplicity: it is no more complex than what we have today, requiring no addit=ional moving parts.""   The implementation of SCR technology requires a chan=ge to the color wheel and light integrating element currently employed in s=ingle-DMD DLP(TM) subsystems, together with changes in the DMD and the driv=e electronics. The optical capability of SCR has been made possible by adva=nces in dichroic and metal thin-film technologies, the most important of th=ese being the photolithographic patterning of dichroic coatings. The SCR co=lor wheel is created from RGB dichroic coatings arranged in a ""spiral of Ar=chimedes"" pattern.   ""This is a tremendously exciting development for DLP t=echnology,"" said Dennis Fritsche, Manager for Business Products at TI's DLP=(TM) Products Division. ""It has been a continuing goal to not only increase= brightness, but also to increase color saturation - and SCR allows us to d=o both. On a panel-to-panel basis, DLP technology has always out-performed =competing technologies. With this invention, we can now, in all respects, m=atch three-panel modulators with a single DMD, but in the small, lightweigh=t projectors that DLP(TM) technology uniquely enables because of its high s=peed and digitally consistent mirror technology. We are now investigating i=mplementation plans and schedules to bring this revolutionary advancement t=o the market place.""   Today, TI supplies DLP(TM) subsystems to more than t=hirty of the world's top projector manufacturers, who then design, manufact=ure and market projectors based on DLP(TM) technology. There are now over f=ifty products based on DLP(TM) technology in the market. Since early 1996, =over 750,000 DLP(TM) subsystems have been shipped. Over the past four years=, DLP(TM) technology-based projectors have consistently won some of the aud=io-visual industry's most prestigious awards, including, in June 1998, an E=mmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.   At the heart of= TI's Digital Light Processing(TM) technology is the Digital Micromirror De=vice optical semiconductor chip. The DMD switch has an array of up to 1,310=,000 hinged, microscopic mirrors which operate as optical switches to creat=e a high resolution, full color image.

In the Hanig v. QUALCOMM= case, the California Superior Court granted summary judgment in QUALCOMM's= favor on all of plaintiffs' claims on the grounds that the releases and ag=reements not to sue executed by each of the plaintiffs barred their lawsuit=. The plaintiffs had signed the releases in exchange for the right to parti=cipate in a bonus retention plan under which QUALCOMM paid millions of doll=ars to its former workers who became employees of Ericsson when QUALCOMM so=ld its infrastructure equipment business. The case was filed by 69 of those= former employees.   In addition, QUALCOMM announced that the plaintiffs in= the May v. QUALCOMM case have agreed to dismiss with prejudice their purpo=rted class action lawsuit against QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM Personal Electronic=s, in which several claims seeking compensation for stock options and bonus= payments had been alleged by a separate group of former employees. The pla=intiffs agreed to dismiss their claims after the court granted QUALCOMM's m=otion dismiss their second amended complaint.   Finally, QUALCOMM announced= that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Califor=nia had granted summary judgment on seventeen of eighteen causes of action =in a purported class action lawsuit arising out of the reduction in force w=hich occurred at the Company in February of 1999. In that case, the purport=ed class representatives had each sought vesting of stock options after the= termination of their employment, even though each had executed releases of= claims in exchange for generous severance payments offered as part of the =separation package. In granting judgment in QUALCOMM's favor on those claim=s, the Court upheld the validity of those releases.   ""We are pleased that =the Company has been completely vindicated in the Hanig and May cases and t=hat virtually all of the claims in the third case have been summarily dismi=ssed,"" said Louis M. Lupin, senior vice president and general counsel for Q=UALCOMM. ""QUALCOMM works very hard to ensure that our employees are treated= not only lawfully, but fairly, and has consistently gone far beyond what t=he Company was legally required to do in providing for our employees and ou=r former employees. Consequently, it is very disappointing when frivolous c=laims such as the ones raised in these cases are made but gratifying when t=heir lack of merit is recognized. We will continue to vigorously defend aga=inst meritless claims such as these.""

New IEEE 802.11g Draft Standard a Win for= WLAN Market Offering 802.11a Data-Rates in the 2.4GHz Band - Includes TI's= 22Mbps Technology=1D- Mandatory Modes: 802.11a OFDM in the 2.4GHz band and= 802.11b CCK - Optional Modes: PBCC-22 From TI and CCK-OFDM   DALLAS, Nov 1=6, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- As a leading participant in the ongoing =work of the IEEE 802.11g Task Group, members from Texas Instruments Incorpo=rated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) helped the body reach a critical technology selectio=n for the 802.11g standard for high-rate wireless networking in the 2.4GHz =band, which will allow multimedia applications to be wirelessly networked a=nd enable the next generation of wireless LAN devices for consumers. The ne=w draft standard, a compromise proposal from TI, Intersil Corp. and several= other companies, combines elements from the final two independent proposal=s that were originally considered for the 802.11g standard. It offers compa=tibility with 802.11b and a set of data-rates up to 54Mbps in the 2.4GHz ba=nd. In addition, the new draft standard also contains modes of operation us=ing PBCC-22 and CCK-OFDM. This integration of modes will enable consumer pr=oducts to support multiple modulations and provides a clear bridge from 11M=bps to 54Mbps data rates.   ""The IEEE has defined a clear path for 802.11g =that bridges 11, 22 and 54 Mbps, making multi-mode products based on one st=andard a reality,"" said Allen Nogee, senior analyst Cahners In-Stat/MRD. ""B=y already offering 22Mbps capabilities with the ACX100, TI and its customer=s are well positioned to enable the first step in the deployment of 802.11g= compliant products in the 2.4GHz band.""   The 802.11g draft standard utili=zes framework from the original proposals for 802.11g which called for OFDM= in the 2.4GHz band as an optional mode to the primary proposed modulation,= either PBCC-22 or CCK-OFDM. The 802.11g draft standard has two mandatory m=odes, OFDM offering 802.11a data rates in the 2.4GHz band, and implementati=on of 802.11b CCK for full backward compatibility. It also offers two optio=nal modes of PBCC-22 and CCK-OFDM, to support rates up to 24Mbps. This bala=nced compromise offers a much clearer bridge between the 802.11a and 802.11=b standards, plus is a straightforward means to develop true multi-mode/RF =devices.   ""TI supports the new IEEE 802.11g draft standard and commends th=e group for its work to reach a well-balanced compromise that offers the WL=AN industry a clear path to support multiple modes within a single standard=,"" said Marc Cetto, general manager Wireless Networking at TI. ""This is a p=ositive development for customers offering or developing products based on =TI's ACX100 solution providing 802.11b compliance with differentiating exte=nded data rates via PBCC-22 now, and be confident that their solutions are =fully embraced by the 802.11 standards organization.""   Now that the techno=logy behind 802.11g has been clarified, TI will be developing 802.11g-compl=iant devices by using elements of its existing 802.11b solution, as well as= its 802.11a work in progress, for availability in mid- 2002. Additionally,= since TI's PBCC-22 is specified in the 802.11g draft, the company's existi=ng devices, which already offer this higher rate feature, will be able to i=nteroperate at 22Mbps with the company's 802.11g-compliant devices that wil=l also offer PBCC-22. This ensures a high degree of forward- compatible int=eroperability at this higher data rate, while maintaining full 802.11b comp=liance. TI is currently shipping the ACX100 to customers offering 802.11b c=ompatibility with 802.11g standards compliant 22Mbps extended data rates al=lowing them to quickly differentiate their products in a less confusing WLA=N ecosystem.   ""TI is a strong proponent of industry standards and has cons=istently and proactively worked with TGg to find a compromise proposal that= would be acceptable to all the members. This effort has paid off in the cr=eation and selection of a compelling proposal in which multiple parties can= walk away as winners, most notably, end consumers of WLAN products,"" said =Bill Carney, director of business development, Wireless Networking at TI.  = Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proce=ssing and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet ag=e.

J.D. Power and Associates and Yahoo! Inc. Report: Nearl=y Two-Thirds of Airline Travelers ``Already Comfortable'' With Flying Again=   WESTPORT, Conn., Oct 23, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Five weeks after Septem=ber 11, a day that involved the worst air catastrophes in the history of th=e United States, J.D. Power and Associates and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) re=port today that nearly two-thirds of airline passengers are ""already comfor=table"" with flying again. Only 3 percent of flyers feel that they will ""nev=er"" be at ease with the air travel experience.   The study was designed by =J.D. Power and Associates and was conducted with Yahoo! Inc., a leading glo=bal Internet communications, commerce and media company. More than 2,200 ad=ults were surveyed about recent air travel experiences and future air trave=l intent.   ""Nearly one in five air travelers are still 'undecided' about w=hether or not they will feel safe traveling on a commercial jet,"" said Mich=ael Taylor, director of travel services at J.D. Power and Associates. ""But =these are positive numbers considering that this survey was conducted less =than five weeks after the September 11 disasters. This report illustrates t=he faith consumers have that air travel will once again be considered safe.=""   However, 72 percent of flyers feel that air travel ""has changed forever=."" The survey went on to ask respondents their perceptions about current sa=fety procedures on aircraft and in airports as well as possible security me=asures that could be implemented.   An overwhelming 83 percent of flyers in=dicated that they did not mind a longer check-in process at airports, as lo=ng as it increased the safety and security of the traveler. More than one-h=alf of airline passengers are willing to pay ""a security tax"" on each ticke=t to provide increased security.   ""A lingering fear of air travel was the =most often cited reason for the public's reduced travel habits,"" said Taylo=r. ""However, business travelers cited a slowing economy as another leading =reason for a slowdown in business travel. Leisure travelers listed 'wanting= to stay closer to home' as another important factor.""   Among current in-f=light security measures, respondents rated in-flight armed air marshals and= armor-reinforced cockpit doors as equally important. Arming cockpit crews =and a ban on silverware in the cabin were reported as much less helpful in =re-establishing consumer confidence in air travel.   At the airport, a sear=ch of all carry-on luggage would inspire the most confidence in travelers i=n addition to existing security measures at airports. The presence of armed= law enforcement officers at the airport ranked a close second. The ban on =cutlery at airport restaurants is not perceived to be very helpful, accordi=ng to survey respondents.   ""To increase public confidence in safety at the= airport, travelers believe that new technologies could be applied quite ef=fectively,"" said Taylor. ""High-technology X-ray and scanning, along with el=ectronic bomb-sniffing equipment, were cited most by respondents. These ite=ms were considered even more effective than Federal control of the airport =security process.""   This public opinion poll was conducted among random vi=sitors to Yahoo's Web site during the week of October 10. More than 1,300 r=espondents reported having air travel experiences within the past three mon=ths.   Headquartered in Agoura Hills, Calif., J.D.

Broadcom Simplifies Gigabit Ethernet System Designs Wit=h New 0.13-Micron QuadSquad(TM) Gigabit Transceiver=1DIndustry-Standard RGM=II With Broadcom's Unique Built-in Timing Adjustment Reduces System Layout =Complexity by More Than 50-Percent   IRVINE, Calif., Oct 29, 2001 /PRNewswi=re via COMTEX/ -- Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq: BRCM), the leading provider= of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications, today announced =the latest member of its QuadSquad(TM) family of Gigabit Ethernet quad tran=sceivers optimized for high-port density Gigabit Ethernet switches and rout=ers. The Broadcom(R) BCM5424 quad transceiver features the Reduced Gigabit =Media Independent Interface (RGMII), which reduces system design complexity= by over 50-percent as compared with the traditional GMII interface. The BC=M5424 and other members of the QuadSquad family facilitate deployment of Gi=gabit Ethernet bandwidth to the desktop by increasing port density and lowe=ring system cost. Utilizing advanced 0.13-micron process technology, Broadc=om's Gigabit transceivers also achieve the industry's lowest power consumpt=ion of less than one watt per port.   ""With the introduction of the BCM5424=, we have reduced design complexity, lowered system cost and accelerated ti=me-to-market for our customers,"" said Marty Colombatto, Vice President and =General Manager of Broadcom's Networking Business Unit. ""Our transceiver in=cludes a unique built-in timing delay mode to eliminate the timing delay tr=ace called for in the RGMII specification. By accommodating this timing del=ay on-chip, the BCM5424 can save up to 96 square inches of layout space for= a 48-port blade, simplifying board design and reducing the number of layer=s required.""   RGMII is a reduced pin count interface that simplifies board= design by lowering the number of interface pins from 25 pins used in the G=MII interface to 12. It also lowers system cost compared to the older GMII =or Ten Bit Interface (TBI) interfaces by reducing the number of layers requ=ired to route high-density networking solutions. Using RGMII, fewer pins ar=e also required for the MAC/switch ASICs, lowering their cost.   To illustr=ate, RGMII saves 1,248 pins in a 48-port switch blade. To achieve that, the= RGMII specification calls for a timing delay on the receive and transmit s=ignals for each port. Each timing delay must be implemented in a board-leve=l trace. These trace lengths are typically arranged in a spiral on the boar=d that takes approximately one square inch of board space per trace. Broadc=om's alternative timing solution provides a DLL-based delay for the receive= and transmit clocks, thus eliminating the need for the timing delay traces=. Given the space requirement for each of the transmit and receive signal t=iming delays on 48 ports, eliminating the timing delay traces can save 96 s=quare inches of layout space.   In addition to the RGMII interface, the BCM=5424 also supports the RTBI interface, which is a reduced pin count version= of the TBI interface.   The BCM5424 incorporates Broadcom's fourth-generat=ion Gigabit Ethernet transceiver technology implemented in the advanced 0.1=3-micron process already proven in production in Broadcom's quad-port BCM54=04 and used in BCM5434 Gigabit Ethernet transceivers and the company's sing=le port BCM5421 copper and BCM5421S copper-plus-fiber transceivers. Broadco=m's Ethernet transceivers are the most widely deployed and field-proven in =the industry, with over 3 million Gigabit Ethernet ports and over 300 milli=on Fast Ethernet ports shipped to date. The BCM5424 is manufactured using t=he advanced 0.13-micron process technology developed by Taiwan Semiconducto=r Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of Broadcom's foundry partners. Collabo=ration between Broadcom and TSMC, drawing on Broadcom's advanced communicat=ions IC expertise and TSMC's process technology knowledge, led to a broad f=amily of mixed signal devices that achieve superior performance, lower cost= and slash power requirements by 50-percent.   The BCM5424 incorporates all= three Ethernet speeds -- 10, 100, and 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) -- w=ith standards-based auto-negotiation, to ensure compatibility with all exis=ting Ethernet network equipment operating over legacy Category 5 copper cab=le plants. Unique Ethernet@Wirespeed(TM) technology enables equipment manuf=actured using the BCM5424 to auto-negotiate to the maximum speed possible o=ver an impaired cable plant, regardless of the maximum speed advertised by =the end-equipment.   The BCM5424 incorporates the industry's most powerful =transceiver DSP engine, delivering over one Teraop (one trillion operations= per second) performance, combined with high-speed, precision mixed-signal =circuits. This processing power ensures robust operation at Gigabit speeds =over the broadest range of existing cable plants. In addition, the BCM5424 =is designed to exceed the IEEE specifications for noise cancellation and tr=ansmission jitter, providing consistent and reliable operation even over ma=rginal cable plants.   The BCM5424's cable diagnostic capability allows use=rs, IT managers and networking equipment manufacturers to remotely analyze =the quality and attributes of the cable, thereby avoiding unnecessary equip=ment returns and service calls. Built-in diagnostics help pinpoint the caus=e of network malfunctions without deploying field support personnel or brin=ging down the network.   Pricing and Availability   The BCM5424 quad Gigabi=t Ethernet transceiver is currently sampling to Broadcom's early access par=tners and is priced at $90 in quantities of 1000 units.

Globalstar Extends Data Services to Telit Phone Units;= Internet Connectivity Now Available On GSM-Compatible Satellite Phones   R=OME & SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Globalstar L.P. and= Telit Mobile Terminals S.p.A. of Italy today announced the commercial intr=oduction of data communications software for Telit Globalstar phones, givin=g users access to the Internet or other data networks, even when they are f=ar outside the range of cellular or other telephone services.   Telit Globa=lstar phones allow users to make calls either over the Globalstar satellite= telephone network or through regular GSM-based cellular networks, GSM bein=g the cellular standard commonly used throughout Europe, the Middle East, A=sia, Africa, Australia and other parts of the world. Telit Globalstar phone=s have been available with voice-call capability in most of these markets f=or nearly two years, but until now they provided data capability only over =GSM terrestrial networks. With the new software introduced today, Telit pho=nes now can provide GSM-like data connectivity over the Globalstar satellit=e network as well.   Globalstar data services, which offer the highest data= speed of any mobile satellite phone service, were originally introduced in= North America in December 2000, using Qualcomm Globalstar phone units whic=h are compatible with CDMA cellular networks common in the U.S. and Canada.= Telit now makes this popular data service available for the first time on =a GSM/satellite phone.   The new Telit data software can be used with eithe=r Telit Model Sat 550 or Sat 600 Globalstar phones. Using a simple adapter =cable, the phone connects to a regular PC serial port and provides asynchro=nous dial-up data capability, generally through a regular Internet service =provider (ISP) or over a private corporate network. Additional dialer and d=river software for PC installation is also provided, with documentation in =eight languages.   When used on the newer-model Telit Sat 600 phone, the ne=w software also provides greatly extended battery life -- up to 24 hours (i=n Globalstar Satellite mode) or more without recharging -- through a new ""s=lotted paging"" function. Previously, Telit Globalstar phones in stand-by mo=de continuously scanned for incoming call signals, rapidly draining battery= power. Slotted paging, which is also used on current generation cellular p=hones, instructs the phone to scan for incoming signals only for a very bri=ef instant every few seconds, resulting in far less battery usage per hour =while in stand-by mode.   Telit is Italy's largest producer of cellular and= satellite phones. Based in Trieste and Rome, Telit products are giving a v=oice to the Mobile Generation, developing products through its network of l=aboratories and cooperative work with universities in Italy and elsewhere i=n Europe.

QUALCOMM Announces New Financial Segment Reporting   SAN= DIEGO, Jan 17, 2002 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM=), today provided access to historical data in its new financial segment re=porting format. The new reporting includes two new segments, called QUALCOM=M Wireless & Internet and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, which were create=d as a result of certain changes in the Company's businesses and managerial= reporting as announced in July 2001. Effective in the first quarter of fis=cal 2002, the Company's complete financial segment reporting includes:   --=  QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) -- develops and supplies         industr=y-leading CDMA chipset and system software solutions         used in networ=k infrastructure equipment, phones and other         wireless devices. QCT =integrates industry-leading capabilities         into its chipsets; includi=ng radioOne(TM) direct conversion         technology and gpsOne(TM) wireles=s position location         technology facilitated by SnapTrack(TM), a whol=ly owned         subsidiary of QUALCOMM.     --  QUALCOMM Technology Licens=ing (QTL) -- licenses the Company's         essential CDMA patent portfolio= to telecom equipment and         consumer electronics manufacturers worldw=ide. To date,         QUALCOMM has licensed over 100 companies to use its p=ortfolio         of over 1,900 U.S. patents and patent applications applica=ble         to CDMA and other technologies.     --  QUALCOMM Wireless & Int=ernet (QWI) -- comprised of the         following businesses:         --  Q=UALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) -- formed to accelerate             the dev=elopment of applications for the wireless Internet,             building on= QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime Environment for             Wireless(TM) (BREW(T=M)) applications platform. The BREW             platform enables hardware m=anufacturers and software             developers to quickly create new prod=ucts and             applications, and allows users to download and run tho=se             applications on their wireless devices.         --  QUALCOMM= Digital Media (QDM) -- develops technologies to             support the pr=ocessing, transmission and management of             content for a variety =of media applications, including the             delivery of digitized moti=on pictures (Digital Cinema) and             highly secure, wireless produc=ts for the U.S. government.         --  QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solution=s (QWBS) -- develops             and provides satellite and terrestrial-bas=ed fleet             management solutions to over 400,000 vehicles in 32   =          countries. The QWBS Network Management Center processes          =   more than seven million transactions per day, making it             one =of the largest wireless data networks in the world.     --  QUALCOMM Strate=gic Initiatives (QSI) -- formed to consolidate         and manage the Compa=ny's strategic investment activities.         QUALCOMM invests in wireless =carriers and manufacturers to         promote the worldwide adoption of CDM=A products and services         for wireless voice and Internet data applic=ations. Generally,         the Company will exit these investments at the e=arliest         possible time, provided the individual circumstances of a  =       particular investment permit an orderly exit without         undermi=ning QUALCOMM's original strategic purpose. Earnings or         losses from= the QSI segment come from interest income,         increases or decreases =in the value of investments (both         realized and unrealized) and QUAL=COMM's share of income or         losses from consolidated subsidiaries and= investments         accounted under the equity method of accounting. From =        time-to-time other income may result from strategic activities     =    such as the sale of an FCC bidding credit in the fourth fiscal         =quarter of 2001.  QUALCOMM is providing new information on the QSI segment =to aid investors' understanding of the investments that the Company has mad=e and the income or losses generated from those investments. QUALCOMM will =separate the financial performance of QSI from its core operating businesse=s because many of these investments are in development-stage companies incu=rring planned accounting losses that are consolidated into QUALCOMM's repor=ted earnings. The Company believes that the new financial segment reporting= will allow investors to more accurately value the different elements of QU=ALCOMM's activities. Under the new financial segment reporting, net earning=s of $0.10 per share for fiscal 2001 and $0.09 per share for fiscal 2000 ha=ve been moved from core operations into the QSI segment.   Historical infor=mation, including revenues and earnings before taxes by segment, is present=ed on QUALCOMM's Investor Relations web site at www.qualcomm.com. QUALCOMM =will report the results of its first fiscal quarter of 2002 using this new =reporting format on January 24, 2002.   QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm=.com) is a leader in developing and delivering innovative digital wireless =communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital te=chnology. The Company's business areas include CDMA chipsets and system sof=tware; technology licensing; wireless fleet management systems, OmniTRACS(R=), TruckMAIL(TM), OmniExpress(R), LINQ(TM); BREW(TM) applications platform;= and satellite-based systems including portions of the Globalstar(TM) syste=m. QUALCOMM owns patents that are essential to all of the CDMA wireless tel=ecommunications standards that have been adopted or proposed for adoption b=y standards-setting bodies worldwide. QUALCOMM has licensed its essential C=DMA patent portfolio to more than 100 telecommunications equipment manufact=urers worldwide. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is included i=n the S?500 Index and is a 2001 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on The Nasdaq= Stock Market(R) under the ticker symbol QCOM.

Earnings And Option Expiration Will Drive The Markets On= Friday - Commentary Part 1     (RealTimeTraders.com) - As we anticipated t=he broad market was quite weak throughout Thursday's session. This was evid=ent by the sharp disparity between the number of advancing issues and decli=ning issues on both markets. However thanks to the strength in few technolo=gy stocks, the Nasdaq Composite managed to hold its ground and finish in th=e positive territory, up 6 points at 1652. The Dow Industrials lost almost =70 points and closed at 9163 and the broader S?500 index lost 8.48 points a=nd closed at 1068. Note that from a technical perspective both the Dow and =the S?500 indices have now broken their recent uptrend.  Thursday after the= close a slew of companies reported their quarterly reports that once again= painted a mixed picture about future earnings. Dow Component Microsoft Cor=p. (MSFT) reported better than expected revenues, but lower net profits and= also warned second quarter and full year earnings would be below street es=timates. On this news the stock traded slightly lower in after hours. On th=e other hand, PeopleSoft, Inc. (PSFT) reported better than expected results= on increased revenues and earnings. From all the earnings reports released= thus far, it seems some of the sectors may be starting to see signs of sta=bilization, but almost none seem to be able to predict when an upturn could= occur in their respective industries. Following are some of the companies =worth watching that reported their results after the close: CA, KLAC, EMLX,= NT, GLW, SUNW, GTW, SFA, AMCC, TQNT, IDTI, XLNX and EBAY.  Given the mixed= earnings picture, it is difficult to anticipate how the markets will react= on Friday morning. However, the momentum is certainly on the downside due =to option expirations and the fact traders are still unwilling to hold posi=tions over the weekend due to continued concerns about America's new war on= Terrorism. We will continue to monitor the markets throughout the session =and alert investors and traders to the overall market conditions and to the= best and worst performing sectors.

Texas Instruments Introduces Inductor-les=s Step-Down Charge Pumps for High Efficiency, Ease of Use in Battery-Operat=ed Systems=1DDevices Offer Industry Leading Output Current Drive of 250mA  = DALLAS, Nov 19, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- A new family of step-down =charge pumps from Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN) (TI) brings power efficienc=y and ease of use to battery-operated systems and PC peripherals. With its =high output drive and built-in protection features, the new charge pumps of=fer savings in board space and system cost. Being the first step-down, or ""=buck"", charge pumps introduced by TI, the new family of devices extends TI'=s comprehensive portfolio of power-supply solutions for low-voltage applica=tions including personal digital assistants and Internet audio players. (Se=e power.ti.com/aap7037u ).   The new TPS6050x step-down charge pumps offer =regulated output voltages ranging from 0.8 to 3.3 volts (V) in order to pow=er low-voltage components in portable and bus-powered systems. The charge p=umps take an input voltage range from 1.8V to 6.5V, enabling use with a var=iety of battery types. Additionally, a low quiescent current of only 40 mic=roamps (uA) allows for longer standby times. At 250 mA, the family provides= the highest output current in the industry and is capable of supporting mu=ltiple components within a system. Finally, with the TPS6050x, only four sm=all ceramic capacitors are required to build a complete high-efficiency cha=rge pump power converter, thereby saving board space and cost.   ""With the =introduction of step-down charge pumps, TI expands its existing line of lin=ear regulators and inductive step-down converters offering a more complete =selection of voltage regulator solutions,"" said Guenter Sporer, systems eng=ineering manager for Low Power DC-DC Converter Products at TI. ""With low-vo=ltage applications becoming more specialized, customers know that they can =rely on TI for power supply solutions that meet their system requirements.""=   Efficiency and Ease of Use   The TPS6050x step-down charge pumps offer o=perating efficiencies comparable to inductive buck converters, yet with the= ease of use that is customary with linear regulators. Peak efficiencies of= 90 percent are achieved by utilizing a fractional conversion topology resu=lting in lower power dissipation and eliminating the need for heat sinking.= Supporting system flexibility, the devices can be powered by three or four= nickel-cadmium (NiCad), nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) or alkaline batteries,= or by a single lithium-ion (Li-ion) cell.   Requiring few external capacit=ors and no inductors, TPS6050x charge pumps simplify design and allow for a= complete converter to be built in only 0.155 square inches (in2). To preve=nt current leakage and prolong battery life, the load is isolated from the =battery during shutdown. Added protection features include a soft start to =limit in-rush current, a Power Good output voltage supervisor, over-tempera=ture and over-current protection.   Available Today   The TPS6050x step-dow=n charge pumps are now available in a 10-pin MSOP package from TI and TI au=thorized distributors. Suggested resale pricing is $1.35 each in quantities= of 1,000. An evaluation module (EVM) is available today to help simplify s=ystem design and speed time to market. Regulated output voltages for the TP=S6050x devices are as follows:   TPS60500   Adjustable 0.8V to 3.3 V      T=PS60501   Fixed 3.3 V      TPS60502   Fixed 1.8 V      TPS60503   Fixed 1.5= V  Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal pr=ocessing and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet= age.

Cost of revenues decreased primarily due to d=ecreased Semiconductor revenue.   - Research and development (R&D) totaled =$358 million, down from $533 million in the third quarter of 2000 primarily= due to acquisition- related charges for in-process R?in the third quarter =of 2000.   - Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter was= $312 million, down from $453 million in the year-ago quarter due to saving=s resulting from restructuring activities and tight spending controls.   - =Other income (expense) net decreased from $565 million in the third quarter= of 2000 to $37 million in the third quarter of 2001, primarily due to a ga=in on the sale of Micron stock in the third quarter of 2000.   - The income= tax rate for the quarter was 47 percent.   - TI orders in the third quarte=r were $1638 million, compared with $3250 million in the year-ago quarter a=nd $1704 million in the second quarter.

Of the $16 million, $15 million is for the acceleration of depreciat=ion over the remaining service life of the facilities. Also included is amo=rtization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of $56 mill=ion.   For the second quarter of 2001, results include net special charges =of $252 million, of which $214 million is severance cost for a worldwide co=st-reduction program and $35 million relates to the restructuring charges f=or the closing of three Semiconductor facilities (Merrimack, New Hampshire;= Tustin, California; and Santa Cruz, California).

Also included i=s amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles of $25= million.   Additional information relating to these items appears below un=der the heading ""Special Charges and Gains.""   OUTLOOK  It appears that thi=rd quarter of 2001 will mark the bottom for semiconductor orders, and the f=loor for revenue should be set in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter TI rev=enue is expected to decline about 10 percent sequentially, mostly due to no=rmal seasonal declines in Educational & Productivity Solutions (E&PS) as we=ll as continued weakness in Semiconductor.   Specifically, TI expects the f=ollowing for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter:   - In Semic=onductor, revenue will decline about 5 percent as continued growth in DSP i=s more than offset by declines in other products.   - Sensors & Controls re=venue will be about even.   - E&PS revenue will decline by about $110 milli=on, or 60 percent, as the back-to-school season for educational products en=ds.   - Operating margin will decline about 9 percentage points before the =effect of special charges and amortization of goodwill and other acquisitio=n-related intangibles, reflecting the lower revenue level and further reduc=tions in inventory.   - Non-operating income will decline about $10 million= reflecting lower interest rates.   - Loss per share will be about 6 cents =more in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter, before the eff=ect of special charges and amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-r=elated intangibles.   For 2001, TI expects the following:   - R?of $1.5 bil=lion, excluding acquisition-related amortization and purchased in-process R=&D, compared with the company's prior estimate of $1.6 billion and last yea=r's $1.6 billion.   - Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, unchanged from =the prior estimate and down about 35 percent from last year.   - Depreciati=on of $1.6 billion, compared with the prior estimate of $1.5 billion and up= about 30 percent from last year.   SEMICONDUCTOR  Semiconductor revenue in= the third quarter was $1453 million, down from $2692 million in the year-a=go period. Revenue was down from $1657 million in the second quarter due to= continued weakness across most Semiconductor products, excluding DSP.   As= a result of lower revenue, Semiconductor had a $219 million operating loss=, compared with an operating profit of $681 million in the year-ago period =and an operating loss of $37 million in the second quarter.   Analog revenu=e was down 45 percent from the year-ago period and 16 percent sequentially =due to broad based weakness in demand. In the first nine months of the year=, about 40 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from Analog.   DSP r=evenue decreased 37 percent from the year-ago quarter due to broad based we=akness in demand but increased 10 percent sequentially due to strength in w=ireless. In the first nine months of the year, about 25 percent of total Se=miconductor revenue came from DSP.   TI's remaining Semiconductor revenue d=ecreased from the year-ago quarter and sequentially.   TI's Semiconductor r=evenue in key markets was as follows:   - Wireless revenue was down 42 perc=ent from the year-ago period but increased 16 percent sequentially. In the =first nine months of the year, about 20 percent of total Semiconductor reve=nue came from wireless.   - Revenue from TI's catalog products, comprised o=f high-performance Analog and DSP, declined 52 percent from the year-ago qu=arter and 16 percent sequentially. In the first nine months of the year, ab=out 15 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from catalog products.  = - Broadband communications revenue, which includes digital subscriber line= (DSL) and cable modems, was up 8 percent from the year-ago quarter but dec=lined 53 percent sequentially. In the first nine months of the year, about =5 percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from broadband communications=.   - Semiconductor orders were $1308 million, compared with $2884 in the y=ear-ago period and $1321 million in the second quarter.   SENSORS  &  CONTR=OLS  Revenue was $222 million, compared with $245 million in the year-ago p=eriod due to overall market weakness, and down from $257 million in the sec=ond quarter due to seasonal patterns in the heating and air conditioning in=dustry and market weakness.   Operating profit was $45 million, or 20.2 per=cent of revenue. Operating profit in the year-ago period was $43 million, o=r 17.5 percent of revenue. Operating profit in the second quarter was $52 m=illion, or 20.2 percent of revenue.   EDUCATIONAL  &  PRODUCTIVITY  SOLUTIO=NS  (E&PS)  E&PS revenue was $179 million, compared with $175 million in th=e year-ago quarter. Sequentially, revenue increased by $50 million due to b=ack-to- school sales of educational products.   Operating profit was $67 mi=llion, or 37.3 percent of revenue, compared with $64 million, or 36.3 perce=nt of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit increased 76 percen=t from the second quarter's $38 million due to seasonality.   FIRST  NINE  =MONTHS  OF  2001  For the first nine months of 2001, TI reported the follow=ing:   - TI revenue was $6414 million, down from $8843 million in the first= nine months of 2000, due to Semiconductor. The decrease in Semiconductor r=evenue for the first nine months of 2001 was primarily due to weakness acro=ss most Semiconductor products. The decrease in Sensors & Controls was prim=arily due to overall market weakness. E&PS was up slightly due to strength =of educational products.   - Cost of revenues was $4452 million compared wi=th $4544 million in the year-ago period. Cost of revenues decreased primari=ly due to decreased Semiconductor revenue.   - R?totaled $1216 million, com=pared with $1306 million in the first nine months of 2000. The decrease was= primarily due to acquisition-related charges for purchased in-process R?in= the first nine months of 2000.   - Selling, general and administrative exp=ense was $1060 million, down from $1268 million in the year-ago period prim=arily due to cost reduction actions and reduced profit sharing.   - Other i=ncome (expense) net decreased from $2039 million in the first nine months o=f 2000 to $201 million for the first nine months of 2001, primarily due to =the sale of Micron stock in 2000.   - The income tax rate was 46 percent.  = - Orders were $5239 million, down from $9601 million for the same period a= year ago, primarily due to weakness in Semiconductor. Semiconductor orders= for the first nine months were down, primarily due to a combination of wea=k electronic end-equipment markets and excess customer inventories. Sensors= & Controls orders were down due to overall market weakness. E&PS orders we=re up slightly due to strength of educational products.   FINANCIAL  CONDIT=ION  In the first nine months of 2001, cash and cash equivalents plus short=-term investments decreased by $1011 million to $2992 million, primarily du=e to capital expenditures. During the third quarter of 2001, cash and cash =equivalents plus short-term investments decreased by $22 million due to the= repurchase of the company's common stock.   Cash flow from operating activ=ities was $1039 million in the first three quarters of 2001.   Capital expe=nditures totaled $1554 million in the first nine months of 2001, compared w=ith $1789 million in the first nine months of 2000. Capital expenditures to=taled $312 million in the third quarter of 2001 versus $585 million in the =year-ago quarter.   Depreciation for the first three quarters of 2001 was $=1145 million, compared with $869 million in the same period a year ago. Dep=reciation for the third quarter of 2001 was $414 million, versus $319 milli=on in the year-ago quarter.   Debt-to-total-capital ratio was 0.10 at the e=nd of the third quarter, the same as at the end of 2000.   In June 2001, th=e Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accou=nting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and O=ther Intangibles, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2=001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have ind=efinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual imp=airment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets wi=ll continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The company will apply= the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets begin=ning in the first quarter of 2002. Application of the non- amortization pro=visions of the Statement is expected to result in an increase in net income= of $100 million ($0.06 per share). During 2002, the company will perform t=he first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived =intangible assets as of January 1, 2002 and has not yet determined what eff=ect, if any, these tests will have on the earnings and financial position o=f the company.   SPECIAL  CHARGES  AND  GAINS  Third Quarter of 2001   As o=f September 30, 2001, $184 million of the $290 million aggregate severance =cost obligations for the first, second and third quarter 2001 worldwide cos=t reduction and restructuring actions affecting a total of 5724 employees h=ad been paid. In total, these first, second and third quarter 2001 actions =are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $400 million.= In the third quarter of 2001, pretax charges of $37 million net were taken=, of which $19 million was severance cost for a worldwide cost- reduction p=rogram affecting 285 employees and $16 million relates to the restructuring= charges for the closing of three Semiconductor facilities (Santa Cruz, Cal=ifornia; Merrimack, New Hampshire; and Tustin, California). Of the $16 mill=ion, $15 million was for the acceleration of depreciation over the remainin=g service life of the facilities. Of the $37 million, $27 million is includ=ed in cost of revenues, $8 million is in selling, general and administrativ=e expense and $2 million is in research and development expense.   Second Q=uarter of 2001   In the second quarter of 2001, pretax charges of $252 mill=ion net were taken, of which $214 million was severance cost for a worldwid=e cost-reduction program affecting 3778 employees and $35 million relates t=o the restructuring charges for the closing of three Semiconductor faciliti=es (Merrimack, New Hampshire; Tustin, California; and Santa Cruz, Californi=a) affecting an additional 559 employees. Of the $35 million charge, $14 mi=llion was for severance cost and $16 million was for the acceleration of de=preciation over the remaining service life of the facilities. Of the $252 m=illion, $162 million was included in cost of revenues, $84 million is in se=lling, general and administrative expense and $6 million is in research and= development expense. Also included was a $68 million increase to the incom=e tax provision to adjust to the expected tax rate for the year.   First Qu=arter of 2001   In the first quarter of 2001, pretax charges of $50 million= net were taken, of which $11 million was for severance cost for 241 first-=quarter employee acceptances under the U.S. voluntary retirement program, $=16 million was for severance cost for restructuring actions affecting 261 e=mployees in international Semiconductor locations, and $25 million relates =to the closing of a Semiconductor manufacturing facility in Santa Cruz, Cal=ifornia. Of the $25 million charge, $16 million was for severance cost for =600 employees and $5 million was for acceleration of depreciation over the =remaining service life of the facility. Of the $50 million, $44 million was= included in cost of revenues, $7 million is in selling, general and admini=strative expense, $2 million is in research and development expense, and $3= million is in other income.   Third Quarter of 2000   In the third quarter= of 2000, TI recorded investment gains of $425 million from the sale of 5.6= million shares of Micron Technology, Inc. (Micron) common stock, offset by= special charges of $163 million net, of which $112 million was for purchas=ed in-process R? costs from the Dot Wireless, Inc. and Alantro Communicatio=ns, Inc. acquisitions, $41 million was for acquisition costs from the pooli=ng of interests with Burr-Brown Corporation, and $10 million, net, was for =several Semiconductor and Sensors & Controls restructuring and other action=s in the U.S., Japan and Europe affecting 432 employees. Of the $163 millio=n, $112 million was included in research and development expense, $46 milli=on is in selling, general and administrative expense, $31 million is in cos=t of revenues, $15 million is in net revenues and $11 million is in other i=ncome. The primary benefit from the above actions is reduced personnel cost=s, which are estimated to reach $31 million annually. The benefit began in =the fourth quarter of 2000. As of September 30, 2001, $13 million of the $1=9 million severance cost obligation had been paid.   Second Quarter of 2000=   In the second quarter of 2000, an investment gain of $1211 million, incl=uded in other income, was realized from the sale of 20 million shares of Mi=cron common stock.   First Quarter of 2000   In the first quarter of 2000, =pretax charges of $29 million net were taken, associated with actions inclu=ding the closing of the Sensors & Controls manufacturing facility in Versai=lles, Kentucky, and TI's acquisition of Toccata Technology ApS. Of the $29 =million charge, $12 million was for severance for the elimination of 480 jo=bs in Kentucky. Of the $29 million, $20 million was included in cost of rev=enues, $6 million is in selling, general and administrative expense and $3 =million is in research and development expense. The primary benefit from th=e Kentucky action is reduced personnel costs, which are estimated to reach =$10 million annually. The benefit began in the fourth quarter of 2000. As o=f September 30, 2001, $9 million of the severance cost obligation had been =paid.   Purchased In-Process R?Charges   Year-to-date acquisition-related p=urchased in-process research and development (R&D) charges were zero in 200=1 and $112 million in 2000. These charges are for R?from business purchase =acquisitions. Values for acquired in-process R?(purchased R&D) were determi=ned at the acquisition date based upon the appraised value of the related d=evelopmental projects. Purchased R?projects were assessed, analyzed and val=ued within the context and framework articulated by the Securities and Exch=ange Commission herein described as the Exclusion Approach.   Major assumpt=ions, detailed in the following table, used in determining the value of sig=nificant purchased R?included the discount rate, the estimated beginning da=te of projected operating cash flows, and the remaining cost and time, in e=ngineer-months, to complete the R?projects. The term ""engineer month"" refer=s to the average amount of research work expected to be performed by an eng=ineer in a month.   The relative stage of completion and projected operatin=g cash flows of the underlying in-process projects acquired were the most s=ignificant and uncertain assumptions utilized in the valuation analysis of =the purchased R&D. Such uncertainties could give rise to unforeseen budget =overruns and/or revenue shortfalls in the event that TI is unable to succes=sfully complete and commercialize the projects. TI management is primarily =responsible for estimating the value of the purchased R?in all acquisitions= accounted for under the purchase method. TI expects to essentially meet it=s original return expectations for the projects.

That's because a Wall Street analyst worked undercoverfor a day at one of the uber-bookseller's distribution centers andthen - what to our wondering eyes should appear - reiterated his ""buy""recommendation on Amazon's stock. It really is the season of miracles!According to the Financial Times, Credit Suisse First Boston analystJamie Kiggen put in a few hours working in Amazon's Delawaredistribution center and then penned this sunny conclusion: ""While ourpresence there suggests the hiring process could be tightened up abit, we were struck by the high level of energy and morale amongwarehouse management and workers alike."" Busy bees are happy bees.Kiggen's stint apparently didn't coincide with one of the six or soall-hands meetings that the New York Times reported Amazon heldrecently to, among other things, squelch unionizing efforts.You'd think journos might give extra scrutiny to Kiggen's dot-com gig,given the recent brouhaha over the New Yorker's similarly themed piecein its Nov. 27 issue. Writer Rodney Rothman was supposedly aiming forhumor, not analysis, when he wrote about his stint working for aSilicon Alley dot-com, according to coverage on the Web site MediaNews. But in a move that has left journos debating the merits ofundercover gigs, he neglected to tell the New Yorker that his motherworked for the firm he infiltrated. And that office massage he wroteso descriptively of? Never really got it. Literary license, you know.But outlets were glowing about Kiggen's undercover gig. CNNfn, whichbroke the ""news,"" speculated that Kiggen and the other CS First Bostonanalysts who cover Amazon ""may have set a new precedent this week forjust how far researchers will go to obtain information on a company.""The Financial Times enthused about Kiggen's ingenuity ""in an era wheninvestors often criticise analysts for being spoon-fed by thecompanies they cover."" And, boy, did Kiggen gather some terrificintelligence. According to the Financial Times, Kiggen's experience inthe Delaware warehouse, which handles as much as 25 percent ofAmazon's orders, ""suggested that the company was 'highly likely' tomeet or exceed fourth-quarter revenue estimates of $1 billion."" Allthis from an eight-hour stint! We guess we at Media Grok just don'tknow how to use our time as wisely.For his part, Kiggen could use a boost for his media profile. Hemissed being named to Fortune's ""all-star analysts"" team, but did getpegged for Business Week's piece on Net analysts' fall from grace.Business Week reported criticism of Kiggen's ""'lifetime value of acustomer' metrics used to justify his bullish Amazon calls"" andincluded the mention in a paragraph on ""voodoo valuation.""

When Gore's chances rise, themarket scowls. Friday was no exception. Around the time of the closingbell, the Florida Supreme Court ordered ""an immediate manual recount""of undervotes in all Florida counties. ""Stock index futures and someshares slumped"" according to CBS MarketWatch's Martin Cej and ChrisKraeuter.Saturday morning brought the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that stoppedthe recounts, and with it some sigh of relief from investors. TheSunday night press was uncharacteristically optimistic, looking forsigns that the uncertainty was close to ending. David Boies, formerMicrosoft slasher and Napster booster and now attorney for Gore, toldFox News that it could be ""the end of the road.""Bloomberg's Monday morning report from Tokyo went further, reportingthat U.S. stocks were up, Treasury bonds down as Bush was seen to bethe winner. ""It looks like we will know who the next president is,""Xinyi Lu, chief strategist at Tokai Bank, told Bloomberg. ""A Bushvictory is bad for bonds because it's good for stocks.''Whichever way it goes, it can't wrap up soon enough for financiers whodespise indecision. ""Until America learns how to run a democracy, themarket can go nowhere,"" said Robin Griffiths, chief technical analystat HSBC Securities on CBS MarketWatch.

Not a sure thing, but those aren't lotterynumbers, either.It's all academic now, at least for a few years. The Pentagon steppedin last week with an agreement to pay the $3 million each month ittakes to keep the constellation flying, at least for another twoyears. It signed the deal with Iridium Satellite, the company thattook over the assets of the original company when it filed forbankruptcy protection this year.Iridium was planned as a global phone system for jet-setters who needto stay in touch wherever their romps take them on the planet. But thecompany's expensive handsets (originally $3,000) and costly service(up to $7 per minute) doomed the service to all except those whoreally needed it - oil-rig crews, transoceanic yachstmen and CNNreporters. Everyone else found that GSM phones get you most of whatyou want for a fraction of the price.But it turns out the Pentagon has plenty of folks who need satellitephones, particularly in the Navy. Iridium ""will provide a commercialalternative to our purely military systems,"" Dave Oliver, principaldeputy under secretary of defense for acquisitions, technology andlogistics, told Reuters. There were other reasons, too. Reuters alsoreported that a U.S. interagency group was nervous about publicreaction to 74 satellites coming down in 14 months. The group wrotethat this ""might create widespread anxiety and lead to a public outcryfor ill-considered government action.""For $3 million per month, the Defense Department bought some time tofigure out what to do: In their current orbits, the satellites won'tfall to earth for about 108 years. By then, however, the danger may beeven worse. As Nicholas Johnson, NASA program manager for orbitaldebris, told Reuters, there will no doubt be more people on earth anda thus higher chance that one of them could get hit. - David SimsNASA: Satellite Odds of Hitting Someone 250-1 (Reuters)http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20001210/sc/tech_satellites_dc_2.htmlPentagon Signs Phone Deal With Iridiumhttp://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-4045594.htmlPentagon to Rescue Iridium (Reuters)http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,40600,00.html/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\NEW PRODUCTS AND SEMINARS FROM HEWLETT PACKARDHewlett Packard's thinking ahead.

A business forecast from UCLA brought out the big needle onMonday and predicted a 60 percent chance of the r-word in 2001. Likeyour doctor, the UCLA economists said it would only pinch a little,and then it would all be over.CBS MarketWatch, Newsbytes and MSNBC provided good summaries of thereport, which insisted everything would be peachy again in 2002.Newsbytes' Michael Bartlett led with some encouragement for deflatedtechie egos: ""The stimulus of the Internet-led 'New Economy' wasenough to keep the current economic expansion in the United Statesdriving forward for four years longer than it might have,"" he said,paraphrasing the report. Funny how everyone's putting ""new economy"" inquotes these days - it used to seem so real.The San Jose Mercury News called the predicted downturn ""recessionlite"" and noted that local California readers ""will escape the worstof it."" (A separate UCLA report on California put the odds of astatewide recession at 40 percent; report author Tom Lieser prefersthe term ""deceleration."") Many experts expect 3 percent growth nextyear, so the Merc's Jennifer Bjorhus called other economist to comparenotes. One Bay Area econ professor agreed that we may be in trouble,but the UCLA report ""has other economists scratching their heads,""said Bjorhus. ""I don't know of anybody else that's out there thatfar,"" said economist Richard Carlson.We do. CBS MarketWatch columnist Paul Farrell wondered if the slumphas already arrived, citing Ken Kurson's article ""Nine Signs We'reAlready in a Recession"" in Esquire's December issue. Kurson's thesismade sense and ""was worth the price of the magazine,"" but in the end,Farrell shrugged it off. ""Neither Esquire's Grinch nor the U.S.Supreme Court is going to steal my Christmas,"" he wrote. If only wecould face the doctor with such self-assurance. - Jen MuehlbauerUCLA Report's Economic Forecast: Recession Litehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730130UCLA's Anderson School Predicts 'Mild Recession' in 2001http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730131UCLA Economists See U.S. Recessionhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730132U.S. Recession Looming, Study Sayshttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730133Recession in 2001?

Sun CFOMichael Lehman did, but by the time he denied it, the stock hadalready taken a hit. ""These rumors have no basis in fact and arefalse,"" said Lehman in an indignant (and redundant) statement releasedon Monday.The rumor said ""a short-seller had published a compelling reportcharging accounting irregularities,"" explained TheStreet.com. Finerpoints were scarce, and that's probably just the way Sun spokespersonMark Paisley liked it. Since the gossip had no source or details,""That should tell you about the quality of the rumor,"" he toldReuters. After Lehman's official denial, Sun shares rebounded a bit inafter-hours trading, showing that some traders who believe rumors alsobelieve prepared corporate statements.Accounting scuttlebutt may have been the catalyst for Friday's Sunselloff, said TheStreet.com, ""But more notable was what thebook-cooking rumor obscured: a survey from small, Chicago researchshop Off The Record Research showing slowing sales of Sun servers toits distributors."" The Financial Times also noted analyst's worriesabout Sun sales, and Wall Street's concerns about Sun's ability tospar with HP, Compaq and IBM. Suddenly, everyone's in the server biz,and Sun's not looking so invincible anymore.Sun did get a bit of good press this week, by helping to form anindustry group to develop online audio and video standards. Thenagain, the group ""is sure to create a battle for market control with(media player companies) RealNetworks Inc. and Microsoft Corp,"" saidthe San Jose Mercury News.

Adult Web-site operators had suedNetwork Solutions because NSI, at the time the sole registrar ofdomain names, refused to issue names the AP characterized as""www.(pickanyobscenity).com."" (Last year, competing registries beganaccepting registrations for such names.) The judge ruled that domainnames are mainly about navigation, not about communicative speech. TheAP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internetexperts on possible reverberations from the case.The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won byan individual against an anonymous online poster. The Post's story, byBrian Krebs of Newsbytes, disentangled the complicated tale moreclearly than did CNET's AP copy. A U.S. District judge awarded$675,000 to an Emory University professor after an anonymous posteraccused him of taking kickbacks. The poster, unmasked in theinvestigation, was a former employee of the company he accused ofmaking the payoff. The Post provided the critical detail that thatcompany had fired the libeler. Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz, a policyanalyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology, for the bottomline: ""There's not much difference between saying slanderous thingsonline or offline. ... In terms of anonymity, it's probably mucheasier to send letters in the mail.""Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicitedcommercial e-mail. The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on arather typical spammer who had hijacked a company's computer to spreadmillions of spams offering porn and get-rich-quick schemes. Whatwasn't typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked downand arrested. He pleaded guilty to second-degree forgery and faces upto seven years in prison.Wired News and InternetNews assigned reporters to the other spam case,this one involving Web host Verio's use of ""whois"" customerinformation from Register.com in violation of the registrar'sacceptable-use policy. The case has not yet gone to trial, but afederal judge ordered Verio to stop using the whois data to barrageRegister.com's customers by e-mail, phone and mail. Writing forInternetNews, Clint Boulton detailed the judge's order and talked tooutside experts on the possible effects of the judge's order. Boultonquoted a Washington lawyer who emphasized the b-to-b aspect of thetussle: ""What this case does is go further in protecting therelationships a business has with its customers."" - Keith DawsonJudge Rules Against Profane Web Domains (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730141Professor Wins Net Libel Suithttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730142Doctor Awarded $675,000 in Net Libel Case (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730143Computer Hijacker Pleads Guiltyhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730144Verio's Alleged Spam Is Temporarily Cannedhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730145Judge Blocks Whois Spamhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730146/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\NEW PRODUCTS AND SEMINARS FROM HEWLETT PACKARDHewlett Packard's thinking ahead.

No, the Other OneSome former Microsoft ""permatemps"" will have a little extra dough topay off their holiday Visa bills. Microsoft will pay about $97 millionto compensate 8,000 to 12,000 long-term temporary employees for thestock-purchase plan they never had.A spate of outlets ran the AP's coverage, including the allegationthat Microsoft's employment practices ""once allowed employees to beclassified as temporary for as long as 14 years."" (Temporary in theBuddhist, ""all is transitory"" way, we assume). The average assignmentwas 10 months, MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters. MS officialsalso insisted that many temps don't want to go on payroll, since theylike the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better. TheWashington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MStemps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired. Asfor the money, ""How many stories have you ever seen about high-techcontractors retiring at 35 because they made millions of dollars?"" aformer two-year temp asked the AP. ""If I had had access to whateveryone else had, I would be in the same financial situation as anumber of friends who are already retired,"" another former tempcomplained to TechWeb.Not that this is all about the bucks, some former permatemps said:Microsoft hurt their feelings. They ""had to wear orange badges, whileregular employees wore blue badges"" and couldn't go to office partiesor shop at the discounted company store, said the New York Times. Norcould they use the corporate health club, added the Washington Post'swriters, who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolicorange badges. ""This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side,""one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News. ""You weretrying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a second-classcitizen."" Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably wentthrough junior high.To get a better sense of the eight-year legal wrangling surroundingthis case, peruse the New York Times, the Washington Post and theSeattle Times. Basically, it comes down to this: Legal eagles say it'snot nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them intothe stock purchase plan, but temps are on their own for healthinsurance. Microsoft got the hint in the mid-'90s, told contractors totake at least 100 days off after sticking around for 12 months, letabout 3,000 employees trade their orange badges for blue ones, andhooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits. So maybe MStemps get that health insurance after all, but ""the company stilldoesn't give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at adiscount,"" said the Merc.Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to high-tech andthe business world in general, but the Seattle Times found acontrarian. ""One thing that has been noteworthy is there haven't beena large number of cases that have been filed (in the wake of theMicrosoft case),"" said the general counsel of the American StaffingAssociation. Nor will the case have ""a material impact on ourresults,"" said MS spokesman Matt Pilla.

As if wobbly tech companies weren'tenough to make everyone nervous, hackers have come out to play.In the ""clich,s come to life"" department, a hacker stole a database ofcredit card numbers from Creditcard.com and posted the numbers online.Creditcards.com, a b-to-b site that helps Web retailers accept creditcard payments, told ZDNet the hacker did his deed on Monday. Thecompany told MSNBC, however, that the suspect broke in four months agoand has been trying to extort Creditcards.com ever since. That wasn'tthe only communications mix-up: The firm never told its customersabout the breach. Creditcards.com also claimed that there was noevidence of credit card fraud, but MSNBC ""was able to find a potentialvictim within a few moments of seeing the database"" - an Illinoiswoman billed for $350 worth of WWF merchandise en route to thePhilippines. Here's a washcloth, Creditcards.com. You've got some eggon your face.In a less serious but equally embarrassing prank, a naughty photo ortwo appeared on the Web site of Japan's National Police Agency. ""Atthis point, nothing has been concluded, only that it was not caused bya virus,"" an NPA spokesperson told the AP. There's no evidence of abreak-in, said Japan's Daily Yomiuri, so maybe visitors were justredirected to a bogus site. Nobody can agree on what sorts ofrevealing photos were used, let alone the technical details.Worry about a hack attack at the University of Washington MedicalCenter - reported as early as Saturday in the Washington Post, SeattleTimes, and Wall Street Journal - ought to get new life from a piece inTuesday's USA Today. Not only can a successful hacker downloadconfidential medical information, said writer Greg Farrell, ""medicalrecords are a veritable treasure trove for those who would make thepatients victims of identity theft."" Yet another hazard of the U.S.health-care system.Finally, Business Week regaled its executive readership with tales ofembittered employees taking revenge via malicious hacking. ""Insiderhacking"" causes $1 billion in damage to U.S. businesses each year,said Business Week's Dennis Blank, and represents 70 percent of allattacks. Maybe Microsoft should be glad its disgruntled permatempsonly sued. - Jen MuehlbauerCreditCards.com Database Stolenhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734107Extortionist Targets Creditcards.comhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734108Hacker Puts Nude Photo on Japanese Police Web Site (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734109Hacker Modifies NPA-Operated Sitehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734110Medical Records Vulnerable to ID Thefthttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734111When the Hacker Is on the Insidehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734112/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\ARE YOU READY FOR KNOWLEDGE-BASED MARKETING?Primary Knowledge provides outsourced data warehousing and businessintelligence tools that help you focus on your most valuable customers.We aggregate isolated silos of online data, giving you a fuller pictureof your customers.

Al Goreis the most obvious choice to lead the disappointed, but techiescoming up short include Compaq and Razorfish (earnings warnings) andAsk Jeeves (layoffs). Then there are those wireless licenses, theauction of which produced a frenzy of interest and money in Europe butstateside are much more modest affairs, and that's a disappointmentfor the FCC.Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories, what with onlinesales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay. The high-priced bids onwireless licenses, however, seem to make the media's eyes glaze over.The Wall Street Journal reminded that wireless-license auctions raised$30 billion in the U.K. and $40 billion-plus in Germany. The U.S.auction, which kicked off Tuesday, is estimated to churn up a mere $15billion to $20 billion, and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst toldthe Journal that $12 billion sounds more likely.Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get what's going on.The Bloomberg posting on News.com helpfully explained that carriersare using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps incoverage, especially in major metropolitan areas. The Journal chimedin (eventually) that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef uptheir coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls. That'swhy, of the 422 licenses covering 195 local markets, the hottestaction was for hopping markets such as New York, Los Angeles andChicago. So far the total bids are up to $501.2 million after tworounds, the FCC told outlets. The highest bids have been $38.2 millioneach by Sprint and DCC PCS, a subsidiary of Dobson Communications, forlicenses in New York City. L.A. was runner-up, with Salmon and Verizonboth bidding $25.5 million for licenses in that market.The Financial Times blamed the absence ""of ruinously expensivespectrum auctions"" on this side of the Atlantic on ""the relativebackwardness of mobile telephony in the U.S."" The pricey auctions inEurope have been for fancy 3G wireless licenses, while the U.S. isstill peddling local markets. Expect ""a proper 3G auction"" to followhere in two years, the peach paper wrote. A jump in third-quarterchurn rates among telco companies signals that competition is startingto bite, the Lex Column warned.

No, the Other OneSome former Microsoft ""permatemps"" will have a little extra dough topay off their holiday Visa bills. Microsoft will pay about $97 millionto compensate 8,000 to 12,000 long-term temporary employees for thestock-purchase plan they never had.A spate of outlets ran the AP's coverage, including the allegationthat Microsoft's employment practices ""once allowed employees to beclassified as temporary for as long as 14 years."" (Temporary in theBuddhist, ""all is transitory"" way, we assume). The average assignmentwas 10 months, MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters. MS officialsalso insisted that many temps don't want to go on payroll, since theylike the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better. TheWashington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MStemps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired. Asfor the money, ""How many stories have you ever seen about high-techcontractors retiring at 35 because they made millions of dollars?"" aformer two-year temp asked the AP. ""If I had had access to whateveryone else had, I would be in the same financial situation as anumber of friends who are already retired,"" another former tempcomplained to TechWeb.Not that this is all about the bucks, some former permatemps said:Microsoft hurt their feelings. They ""had to wear orange badges, whileregular employees wore blue badges"" and couldn't go to office partiesor shop at the discounted company store, said the New York Times. Norcould they use the corporate health club, added the Washington Post'swriters, who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolicorange badges. ""This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side,""one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News. ""You weretrying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a second-classcitizen."" Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably wentthrough junior high.To get a better sense of the eight-year legal wrangling surroundingthis case, peruse the New York Times, the Washington Post and theSeattle Times. Basically, it comes down to this: Legal eagles say it'snot nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them intothe stock purchase plan, but temps are on their own for healthinsurance. Microsoft got the hint in the mid-'90s, told contractors totake at least 100 days off after sticking around for 12 months, letabout 3,000 employees trade their orange badges for blue ones, andhooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits. So maybe MStemps get that health insurance after all, but ""the company stilldoesn't give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at adiscount,"" said the Merc.Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to high-tech andthe business world in general, but the Seattle Times found acontrarian. ""One thing that has been noteworthy is there haven't beena large number of cases that have been filed (in the wake of theMicrosoft case),"" said the general counsel of the American StaffingAssociation. Nor will the case have ""a material impact on ourresults,"" said MS spokesman Matt Pilla.

As if wobbly tech companies weren'tenough to make everyone nervous, hackers have come out to play.In the ""clich,s come to life"" department, a hacker stole a database ofcredit card numbers from Creditcard.com and posted the numbers online.Creditcards.com, a b-to-b site that helps Web retailers accept creditcard payments, told ZDNet the hacker did his deed on Monday. Thecompany told MSNBC, however, that the suspect broke in four months agoand has been trying to extort Creditcards.com ever since. That wasn'tthe only communications mix-up: The firm never told its customersabout the breach. Creditcards.com also claimed that there was noevidence of credit card fraud, but MSNBC ""was able to find a potentialvictim within a few moments of seeing the database"" - an Illinoiswoman billed for $350 worth of WWF merchandise en route to thePhilippines. Here's a washcloth, Creditcards.com. You've got some eggon your face.In a less serious but equally embarrassing prank, a naughty photo ortwo appeared on the Web site of Japan's National Police Agency. ""Atthis point, nothing has been concluded, only that it was not caused bya virus,"" an NPA spokesperson told the AP. There's no evidence of abreak-in, said Japan's Daily Yomiuri, so maybe visitors were justredirected to a bogus site. Nobody can agree on what sorts ofrevealing photos were used, let alone the technical details.Worry about a hack attack at the University of Washington MedicalCenter - reported as early as Saturday in the Washington Post, SeattleTimes, and Wall Street Journal - ought to get new life from a piece inTuesday's USA Today. Not only can a successful hacker downloadconfidential medical information, said writer Greg Farrell, ""medicalrecords are a veritable treasure trove for those who would make thepatients victims of identity theft."" Yet another hazard of the U.S.health-care system.Finally, Business Week regaled its executive readership with tales ofembittered employees taking revenge via malicious hacking. ""Insiderhacking"" causes $1 billion in damage to U.S. businesses each year,said Business Week's Dennis Blank, and represents 70 percent of allattacks. Maybe Microsoft should be glad its disgruntled permatempsonly sued. - Jen MuehlbauerCreditCards.com Database Stolenhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734107Extortionist Targets Creditcards.comhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734108Hacker Puts Nude Photo on Japanese Police Web Site (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734109Hacker Modifies NPA-Operated Sitehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734110Medical Records Vulnerable to ID Thefthttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734111When the Hacker Is on the Insidehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284790&d=734112/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\ARE YOU READY FOR KNOWLEDGE-BASED MARKETING?Primary Knowledge provides outsourced data warehousing and businessintelligence tools that help you focus on your most valuable customers.We aggregate isolated silos of online data, giving you a fuller pictureof your customers.

Al Goreis the most obvious choice to lead the disappointed, but techiescoming up short include Compaq and Razorfish (earnings warnings) andAsk Jeeves (layoffs). Then there are those wireless licenses, theauction of which produced a frenzy of interest and money in Europe butstateside are much more modest affairs, and that's a disappointmentfor the FCC.Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories, what with onlinesales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay. The high-priced bids onwireless licenses, however, seem to make the media's eyes glaze over.The Wall Street Journal reminded that wireless-license auctions raised$30 billion in the U.K. and $40 billion-plus in Germany. The U.S.auction, which kicked off Tuesday, is estimated to churn up a mere $15billion to $20 billion, and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst toldthe Journal that $12 billion sounds more likely.Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get what's going on.The Bloomberg posting on News.com helpfully explained that carriersare using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps incoverage, especially in major metropolitan areas. The Journal chimedin (eventually) that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef uptheir coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls. That'swhy, of the 422 licenses covering 195 local markets, the hottestaction was for hopping markets such as New York, Los Angeles andChicago. So far the total bids are up to $501.2 million after tworounds, the FCC told outlets. The highest bids have been $38.2 millioneach by Sprint and DCC PCS, a subsidiary of Dobson Communications, forlicenses in New York City. L.A. was runner-up, with Salmon and Verizonboth bidding $25.5 million for licenses in that market.The Financial Times blamed the absence ""of ruinously expensivespectrum auctions"" on this side of the Atlantic on ""the relativebackwardness of mobile telephony in the U.S."" The pricey auctions inEurope have been for fancy 3G wireless licenses, while the U.S. isstill peddling local markets. Expect ""a proper 3G auction"" to followhere in two years, the peach paper wrote. A jump in third-quarterchurn rates among telco companies signals that competition is startingto bite, the Lex Column warned. The high-priced ""auction risk""remains, Lex warned, but don't expect much.

That's because a Wall Street analyst worked undercoverfor a day at one of the uber-bookseller's distribution centers andthen - what to our wondering eyes should appear - reiterated his ""buy""recommendation on Amazon's stock. It really is the season of miracles!According to the Financial Times, Credit Suisse First Boston analystJamie Kiggen put in a few hours working in Amazon's Delawaredistribution center and then penned this sunny conclusion: ""While ourpresence there suggests the hiring process could be tightened up abit, we were struck by the high level of energy and morale amongwarehouse management and workers alike."" Busy bees are happy bees.Kiggen's stint apparently didn't coincide with one of the six or soall-hands meetings that the New York Times reported Amazon heldrecently to, among other things, squelch unionizing efforts.You'd think journos might give extra scrutiny to Kiggen's dot-com gig,given the recent brouhaha over the New Yorker's similarly themed piecein its Nov. 27 issue. Writer Rodney Rothman was supposedly aiming forhumor, not analysis, when he wrote about his stint working for aSilicon Alley dot-com, according to coverage on the Web site MediaNews. But in a move that has left journos debating the merits ofundercover gigs, he neglected to tell the New Yorker that his motherworked for the firm he infiltrated. And that office massage he wroteso descriptively of? Never really got it. Literary license, you know.But outlets were glowing about Kiggen's undercover gig. CNNfn, whichbroke the ""news,"" speculated that Kiggen and the other CS First Bostonanalysts who cover Amazon ""may have set a new precedent this week forjust how far researchers will go to obtain information on a company.""The Financial Times enthused about Kiggen's ingenuity ""in an era wheninvestors often criticise analysts for being spoon-fed by thecompanies they cover."" And, boy, did Kiggen gather some terrificintelligence. According to the Financial Times, Kiggen's experience inthe Delaware warehouse, which handles as much as 25 percent ofAmazon's orders, ""suggested that the company was 'highly likely' tomeet or exceed fourth-quarter revenue estimates of $1 billion.""

When Gore's chances rise, themarket scowls. Friday was no exception. Around the time of the closingbell, the Florida Supreme Court ordered ""an immediate manual recount""of undervotes in all Florida counties. ""Stock index futures and someshares slumped"" according to CBS MarketWatch's Martin Cej and ChrisKraeuter.Saturday morning brought the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that stoppedthe recounts, and with it some sigh of relief from investors. TheSunday night press was uncharacteristically optimistic, looking forsigns that the uncertainty was close to ending. David Boies, formerMicrosoft slasher and Napster booster and now attorney for Gore, toldFox News that it could be ""the end of the road.""Bloomberg's Monday morning report from Tokyo went further, reportingthat U.S. stocks were up, Treasury bonds down as Bush was seen to bethe winner. ""It looks like we will know who the next president is,""Xinyi Lu, chief strategist at Tokai Bank, told Bloomberg. ""A Bushvictory is bad for bonds because it's good for stocks.''Whichever way it goes, it can't wrap up soon enough for financiers whodespise indecision. ""Until America learns how to run a democracy, themarket can go nowhere,"" said Robin Griffiths, chief technical analystat HSBC Securities on CBS MarketWatch.

Not a sure thing, but those aren't lotterynumbers, either.It's all academic now, at least for a few years. The Pentagon steppedin last week with an agreement to pay the $3 million each month ittakes to keep the constellation flying, at least for another twoyears. It signed the deal with Iridium Satellite, the company thattook over the assets of the original company when it filed forbankruptcy protection this year.Iridium was planned as a global phone system for jet-setters who needto stay in touch wherever their romps take them on the planet. But thecompany's expensive handsets (originally $3,000) and costly service(up to $7 per minute) doomed the service to all except those whoreally needed it - oil-rig crews, transoceanic yachstmen and CNNreporters. Everyone else found that GSM phones get you most of whatyou want for a fraction of the price.But it turns out the Pentagon has plenty of folks who need satellitephones, particularly in the Navy. Iridium ""will provide a commercialalternative to our purely military systems,"" Dave Oliver, principaldeputy under secretary of defense for acquisitions, technology andlogistics, told Reuters. There were other reasons, too. Reuters alsoreported that a U.S. interagency group was nervous about publicreaction to 74 satellites coming down in 14 months. The group wrotethat this ""might create widespread anxiety and lead to a public outcryfor ill-considered government action.""For $3 million per month, the Defense Department bought some time tofigure out what to do: In their current orbits, the satellites won'tfall to earth for about 108 years. By then, however, the danger may beeven worse. As Nicholas Johnson, NASA program manager for orbitaldebris, told Reuters, there will no doubt be more people on earth anda thus higher chance that one of them could get hit. - David SimsNASA: Satellite Odds of Hitting Someone 250-1 (Reuters)http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20001210/sc/tech_satellites_dc_2.htmlPentagon Signs Phone Deal With Iridiumhttp://news.cnet.com/news/0-1004-200-4045594.htmlPentagon to Rescue Iridium (Reuters)http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,40600,00.html/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\NEW PRODUCTS AND SEMINARS FROM HEWLETT PACKARDHewlett Packard's thinking ahead.

Huffstutter as""he."" Ms. Huffstutter is a ""she."" We regret the error.TOP GROKS~~~~~~~~~Economists: Relax, This Won't Hurt a BitMost of us like recession speculation about as much as we like tetanusshots. A business forecast from UCLA brought out the big needle onMonday and predicted a 60 percent chance of the r-word in 2001. Likeyour doctor, the UCLA economists said it would only pinch a little,and then it would all be over.CBS MarketWatch, Newsbytes and MSNBC provided good summaries of thereport, which insisted everything would be peachy again in 2002.Newsbytes' Michael Bartlett led with some encouragement for deflatedtechie egos: ""The stimulus of the Internet-led 'New Economy' wasenough to keep the current economic expansion in the United Statesdriving forward for four years longer than it might have,"" he said,paraphrasing the report. Funny how everyone's putting ""new economy"" inquotes these days - it used to seem so real.The San Jose Mercury News called the predicted downturn ""recessionlite"" and noted that local California readers ""will escape the worstof it."" (A separate UCLA report on California put the odds of astatewide recession at 40 percent; report author Tom Lieser prefersthe term ""deceleration."") Many experts expect 3 percent growth nextyear, so the Merc's Jennifer Bjorhus called other economist to comparenotes. One Bay Area econ professor agreed that we may be in trouble,but the UCLA report ""has other economists scratching their heads,""said Bjorhus. ""I don't know of anybody else that's out there thatfar,"" said economist Richard Carlson.We do. CBS MarketWatch columnist Paul Farrell wondered if the slumphas already arrived, citing Ken Kurson's article ""Nine Signs We'reAlready in a Recession"" in Esquire's December issue. Kurson's thesismade sense and ""was worth the price of the magazine,"" but in the end,Farrell shrugged it off. ""Neither Esquire's Grinch nor the U.S.Supreme Court is going to steal my Christmas,"" he wrote. If only wecould face the doctor with such self-assurance. - Jen MuehlbauerUCLA Report's Economic Forecast: Recession Litehttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730130UCLA's Anderson School Predicts 'Mild Recession' in 2001http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730131UCLA Economists See U.S. Recessionhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730132U.S. Recession Looming, Study Sayshttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730133Recession in 2001?

Sun CFOMichael Lehman did, but by the time he denied it, the stock hadalready taken a hit. ""These rumors have no basis in fact and arefalse,"" said Lehman in an indignant (and redundant) statement releasedon Monday.The rumor said ""a short-seller had published a compelling reportcharging accounting irregularities,"" explained TheStreet.com. Finerpoints were scarce, and that's probably just the way Sun spokespersonMark Paisley liked it. Since the gossip had no source or details,""That should tell you about the quality of the rumor,"" he toldReuters. After Lehman's official denial, Sun shares rebounded a bit inafter-hours trading, showing that some traders who believe rumors alsobelieve prepared corporate statements.Accounting scuttlebutt may have been the catalyst for Friday's Sunselloff, said TheStreet.com, ""But more notable was what thebook-cooking rumor obscured: a survey from small, Chicago researchshop Off The Record Research showing slowing sales of Sun servers toits distributors."" The Financial Times also noted analyst's worriesabout Sun sales, and Wall Street's concerns about Sun's ability tospar with HP, Compaq and IBM. Suddenly, everyone's in the server biz,and Sun's not looking so invincible anymore.Sun did get a bit of good press this week, by helping to form anindustry group to develop online audio and video standards. Thenagain, the group ""is sure to create a battle for market control with(media player companies) RealNetworks Inc. and Microsoft Corp,"" saidthe San Jose Mercury News.

Adult Web-site operators had suedNetwork Solutions because NSI, at the time the sole registrar ofdomain names, refused to issue names the AP characterized as""www.(pickanyobscenity).com."" (Last year, competing registries beganaccepting registrations for such names.) The judge ruled that domainnames are mainly about navigation, not about communicative speech. TheAP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internetexperts on possible reverberations from the case.The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won byan individual against an anonymous online poster. The Post's story, byBrian Krebs of Newsbytes, disentangled the complicated tale moreclearly than did CNET's AP copy. A U.S. District judge awarded$675,000 to an Emory University professor after an anonymous posteraccused him of taking kickbacks. The poster, unmasked in theinvestigation, was a former employee of the company he accused ofmaking the payoff. The Post provided the critical detail that thatcompany had fired the libeler. Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz, a policyanalyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology, for the bottomline: ""There's not much difference between saying slanderous thingsonline or offline. ... In terms of anonymity, it's probably mucheasier to send letters in the mail.""Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicitedcommercial e-mail. The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on arather typical spammer who had hijacked a company's computer to spreadmillions of spams offering porn and get-rich-quick schemes. Whatwasn't typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked downand arrested. He pleaded guilty to second-degree forgery and faces upto seven years in prison.Wired News and InternetNews assigned reporters to the other spam case,this one involving Web host Verio's use of ""whois"" customerinformation from Register.com in violation of the registrar'sacceptable-use policy. The case has not yet gone to trial, but afederal judge ordered Verio to stop using the whois data to barrageRegister.com's customers by e-mail, phone and mail. Writing forInternetNews, Clint Boulton detailed the judge's order and talked tooutside experts on the possible effects of the judge's order. Boultonquoted a Washington lawyer who emphasized the b-to-b aspect of thetussle: ""What this case does is go further in protecting therelationships a business has with its customers."" - Keith DawsonJudge Rules Against Profane Web Domains (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730141Professor Wins Net Libel Suithttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730142Doctor Awarded $675,000 in Net Libel Case (AP)http://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730143Computer Hijacker Pleads Guiltyhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730144Verio's Alleged Spam Is Temporarily Cannedhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730145Judge Blocks Whois Spamhttp://tm0.com/thestandard/sbct.cgi?s=64349541&i=284481&d=730146/=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= advertisement =-=-=\NEW PRODUCTS AND SEMINARS FROM HEWLETT PACKARDHewlett Packard's thinking ahead.

These savings, general=ly in  the range of 40 to 60%, allow New Century to be the most  price comp=etitive manufacturer of Vertical Boring Mills  in the U.S. These cost savin=gs are passed on to New Century  customers and afford them the opportunity =to manufacture  rotating turbine components for power generation at better = costs.

[IMA=GE]   [IMAGE]     Torbay's  KAT Catches Media, Investor Attention    NEW  Y=ORK, Nov 8, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- After announcing its  acquisition of th=e groundbreaking KAT(SM) computer mouse,  Torbay Holdings, Inc. (OTC:BB,TRB=Y), has received a favorable  response from the media and investing communi=ty. Tom Large,  Torbay CEO, was recently interviewed for a CEOcast profile = http://www.ceocast.com ). Further, the company has been the  recipient of =strong interest from a major New York investment  firm, with discussions co=ntinuing.     The  KAT's medically conceived ergonomic design has been hail=ed  as a breakthrough in computer mouse technology. It has been  proven in =clinical studies to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome,  a common workplace i=njury resulting from computer use. Given  that over half of all worker inju=ry claims are related to  Repetitive Strain Syndrome, of which carpal tunne=l syndrome  is a significant part, the implications for appreciably  reduci=ng worker injury claims is significant.  CEO  Tom Large stated: ""I am pleas=ed with the response to  our announcement, as we are about to commence a ma=jor promotional  campaign. If the reaction to date reflects future interest=,  then Torbay should very quickly begin to see its full value  realized."" = Outlets  for the manufacture and distribution of the KAT have been  establ=ished in the US, Europe and the Far East, with official  production dates t=o be announced in the near future.
