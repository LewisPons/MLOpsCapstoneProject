Following that idea, I think that the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the burden/risk of the prospective refund period.I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power / retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can given the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this fight.I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bring these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our other arguments.Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, can you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  I want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not getting too soft.Jim",

I dont have much to report. I have been traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling rivalries goingI have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?",

We cannot retroactively buy from PG&E.  So we will have to argue that PG&E owes us this money in the CPUC.Our large customers, if not on the hook for the expected ctc that results from this proposal, could say that they refuse to let us take advantage of the lower costs prices because it comes with a recovery ctc period.  We have to hope that all customers are required to participate in the ctc regardless of who serves them. ",

Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major outstanding business issues.  At this meeting, the point is going to be made that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to increase its technical effort.  Presently, we are concerned that the technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing).  We are going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical resources to this goal.  One of our priorities is to bring the technical portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an order.  I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the information that they owe us before this meeting.2.  We have redrafted the purchase order.  However, the P.O. needs refinement to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined (much of the information that I sent you).  Given 1) the proposed payment mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and ultimately payment issues.  Also, we are concerned that once we make our state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of our major focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that the technical sections of the P.O. are properly defined.3.  With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revised estimates no later than tomorrow.  Our current plan is to make a state filing (CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding)  which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates (we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges.  You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost and technical information provided in the filing.  A draft of the filing is to be sent to CRRA by 11/3.  Given this approach, it is less important that we go to the sites next week.  Our focus should be on getting the purchase order into shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the state filing is accurate as to our base technical assumptions.4.  The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week.Please give me a call if you have any questions.",

I would suggest Jean Ryall - who heads our Texas government/regulatory affairs team.  She is certainly more familiar with the details (of which there will be many more after this legislative session and the conclusion of the pilot program).  She is also a very good speaker (and can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up).From: Susan Skarness/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/2001 11:20 AMTo: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Beta Gamma SigmaSteve,I am a member of Beta Gamma Sigma (BGS), the honor society for business programs accredited by AASCB - The International Association for Management Education.  If you are not familiar with BGS, a member must be in the upper 5% of their class as a junior and the upper 10% as a senior and in graduate school to be nominated for induction into the society.In an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members, alumni chapters are being developed around the country.  There are currently nine alumni chapters around the U.S. with a new one being formed in the Houston area.  I am serving on a steering committee for the development of this Houston Area Alumni Chapter.  Our primary reasons for starting a Houston Area Chapter include networking, professional affiliations, outreach to students, resources, learning opportunities, and providing scholarships.Our initial outreach to Beta Gamma Sigma members will be through a reception/dinner to be held in October 2001.  We are currently looking at either October 16 or 18.  All 6,200 Houston area members will be invited to participate, however, we expect attendance to be closer to 75-100 people.  The ages, experiences, and business affiliation of the members will be very diverse, but all will have the common thread of business excellence.The details of this event are still being finalized; however, at our last meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics.  Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas, and since I work at Enron, I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker.  Cliff Baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic.  Are you available and willing to address this group in October?  If I can provide any additional information, please let me know.Thank you for your consideration, Steve.",

An understanding of VaR is rapidly becoming an integral business need.  The first session of this seminar provides participants with a comprehensive review of statistics, these being the primary building block of VaR itself.  The program then moves on to identify examples of the context in which clients are using VaR in their business decisions.  Participants will gain an understanding of the interrelationship of the many factors that make VaR a dynamic and strategic tool.  The program ends with a ""hands on"" experience of making a simple VaR calculation.Participants attending this seminar will be able to:Give a precise definition of Value at RiskDescribe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their businessesDiscuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging  productsRecognize why companies are implementing VaRExplain the key factors in calculating VaRUnderstand the need to categorize risk into ""Risk Buckets""Define the standardizing practice of Risk MappingIllustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling         processCalculate a simple two product VaR numberDemonstrate the difference between the Historical, Monte Carlo and Risk Metrics  approaches to VaREvaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaRUnderstand the application and importance of stress testing",

Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday.----- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 10/31/2000 07:24 AM -----Rosalee Fleming10/30/2000 06:00 PM  To: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com cc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Hoecker letter",

Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies aredemanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The endzones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdownsthat went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scoredthirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size,shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coachBob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said sobefore we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with theoutcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points manytimes.""A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well asthat damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""Weare confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner ofthe game,"" says Slocum.OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zoneswere used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""says Stoops.Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearingsigns such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoedtheir signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare awinner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare awinner.""ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off itsprediction.College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with anumber of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we werecertain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in ourprediction.""",

In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.Thanks.",

The full amount of Pecos/Roberson's gas received at meter 6753 and delivered out at meter 8714 (Vastar) will be kept whole.

In sum, due to the governor's sudden panic and  resultant willingness to negotiate, all parties are in a wait-and-see mode that  makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing  early next week.  Our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome, but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend.  Creditors, especially the small IPPs are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations.The events given in this report are  chronological: - The original plan proposed by Governor Davis to  the utilities this morning contained the following points:The parent companies of the utilities would have  to return to their subsidiaries $1.5 billion.  This money was originally  tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it  to pay taxes.  However, as was revealed in the audit, this money was in  excess of what was needed for taxes in reality.The state would purchase the transmission assets  for $3.5 billion.It was proposed that the utilities would issue  bonds to pay for the utilities' undercollection.  These bonds would be  secured against a ""distribution charge"" added to power bills.  This money  would be collected by DWR and transferred to the utilities, thereby involving  the state, but with less than a ""full faith and credit""  commitment.- In contradiction to preliminary reports that  appeared in the press, this plan was rejected by the utilities.  One reason  for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets. - While the bondholders pressed for further  negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached; this is  because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators. The generators,  however, demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to  move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing. - Local sources report that Governor Davis  ""panicked"" at this point.  He then offered to purchase the transmission  assets for $6 billion (almost twice the earlier offer) and pay the generators'  undercollection (which amounts to $9 to $12 billion).  Reportedly, the  suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail-out was 15  years, which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail-out.  This  plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill. - At this point, consumer advocate Harvey  Rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer's office.  Rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan, he would start a  referendum to counter it.  Rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the  emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place.  Knowledgeable  sources advise that it would be ""very difficult"" for the bonds in the plan to be  issued in less than 90 days; therefore, Rosenfield poses a credible  threat. - In subsequent negotiations, Governor Davis has  offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $6 billion,  but possibly as high as $12 billion. - Senator President Pro Tem John Burton is 'very  upset' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so  easily. - Mike Florio, another consumer advocate, contacted  Gov. Davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail-out, as it  appeared Davis intended to do, was ""ridiculous.""  Florio and the other  consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with Rosenfield and support the  referendum if Davis pursued such a course of action.  The consumer  advocates strongly feel that the generators have to ""take a hair cut"" as part of  the solution, as well. - The governor will announce later this afternoon a  ""framework"" solution identical to that we have reported previously - a  state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities,  but with state support through the DWR.  However, the state government has  yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework, and it remains unclear  whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties. - With this announcement, the bondholders  may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the  final agreement will be.  The generators, while more inclined to file  themselves, may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it  may be worthwhile to wait and see, as well.  They are interested not only  in the terms of the agreement (and particularly the amount paid for the  undercollect), but also in the terms of the long-term power contracts that the  state must negotiate.  For example, if the state is willing to purchase  power at high prices in order to placate the generators, they would be very  likely to go along with the plan. - ",

In case we miss each other Tuesday, I will be meeting with the VP of TotalFinaElf regarding supplying gas under the Frontera transaction, talking about several of their chemical plants in addition to discuss trading with them daily. After lunch I will be meeting with BP Amoco to talk about several plant deliveries as well as look at daily trading with them.

He said the view in the PX is that Enron is stalling.  I gave him the other side of the story.  He thinks nothing will be done until the next Market Monitoring COm meeting later this month (the PX web site does not list the date),  He says the matter will likely be discussed in Executive Session.  He also believes that the PX wants to meet with Enron and isn't likely to do anything publicly until after that meeting.Unfortunately, from talking to John, the perception at the PX appears to be that this matter should be handled like the Chicago Board of Trade where they monthly release a list of offenders and what they have done, and nobody thinks much about it.  It's routine.  That's the wat they want these to be in the future, but they realize that this one -- the first -- will seem much bigger than that because it is first.He said we got stuck because we did something significant and they really didn't have any process set up to handle these things.  He said the compliance staff has only gotten some real analytical skills as of Nov (although he mentioned outside consultants looked at our case).  We also aren't being picked on.  Other people are being investigated, but we're coming through first.  I asked about utility pressure.  He said he has been asked about the investigation by utility people, but doesn't believe it has caused any undue pressure on the PX.  He said, if they were being pressured, the investigation would have been completed by now.He said that they don't want to give the matter any more significance than it has, but they can't ignore it.  A 3000MW schedule over a 30 MW line just can't be ignored, he said.I didn't ask him for a heads' up on the public release of the letter, but I feel I can call him for updates at any time.",

Here's the most interesting thing... El Paso waived its right of first refusal under the one year deal done last year, and participated with everyone else in the open season.  Accordingly, they were allocated capacity along with everyone else.  Remember, all these deals were [supposedly] done at EPNG's max rates.  There were approx. 30 successful bidders, and their bids were for various term lengths.  Here are the more significant awards:Burlington-  7,000CEG Energy Options-  37,800Coral-  15,000Duke-  212,000Dynegy- 56,500El Paso Merchant- 277,000ENA-  254,000MGI Supply (Pemex)- 38,000Oxy-  19,000PG&E (et al.)- 151,000SMUD-  10,000Sempra Trading-  6,500SoCal- 19,000Texaco-  58,500Williams- 11,500Here's the other EPNG news flash... apparently, EPNG is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system.  I'm assuming at this point this project will include the All American pipeline asset.I'm also now told that the Kern River expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago.  We heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 MMcf/d expansion that would include the 124 MMcf/d expansion already sold.  New information suggests that the 500 MMcf/d expansion may be significantly understated, and volumes may approach 700 - 800 MMcf/d.  The expansion would include not only compression, but would involve additional pipe, and would not be rolled into existing rates, but would be an incrementally priced project.",

Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation.Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  ""we would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language"" (which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm to engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.    ",

When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. Crude and Products groupMid-marketingBill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  OriginationIn order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.

The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  ShippingScott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.WeatherThe weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  CoalMark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.Enron JapanThe momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.LNGLNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.Enron Freight MarketsEFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.

Many independent softwarevendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applicationsto use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieveoutright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some ofthe original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software.Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of""Pervasive SQL 2000,"" a true relational database system whichnevertheless still purports to support applications written to theBtrieve 6.x specification.A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is nolonger an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell stilluses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed productsdatabase (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000  enough for theadministrator to add new products and services, but not enough for anyBtrieve-based applications the network might be running.There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s anevaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-uselicenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your softwarevendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administratorscould be caught off-guard when applications stop working.For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn'ttested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and  the realkiller  most current applications (such as Computer AssociatesArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade toNetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining therequisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what youwant to do, or if switching to a different application is the betterchoice.To contact Dave Kearns:-----------------------Dave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing agencyserving the computer and networking industries.

There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.?Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:?1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a laptop.?2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably PowerPoint). ?3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my colleague, Claire as soon as possible.?If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.?I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.?Kind regards?Andreas_____________________________Andreas  SimouGARP 2001 - Conference ProducerTel? +44 (0) 20 7626  9301Fax +44 (0) 20 7626 9900?Don't miss the GARP 2001 Convention, program  details via our web sitewww.garp.com   - speaker checklist.doc",

I have a feeling we're going to lean towardthe 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) butwe should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.Thanks again.KR-----Original Message-----From: Conway, Frank P [mailto:ConwayFP@navair.navy.mil]Sent: Thursday, October 04, 2001 2:27 PMTo: Ruscitti, KevinSubject: RE: Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCHsmoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're reallypushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what youwillnotice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).Onceyou jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want asmoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way youdrive(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low endpower inthe 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most ofthetime, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind abit.Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way itwill be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank(largein that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so yourperformancewill seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that pricerangeis to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive ofboth.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a coupleofweeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan onhanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer togo2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quiteawhile if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.Capt. Frank P.

The problemisthe blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grandinto it.I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is reallybigin Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaningtoward theBMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it'sa littlesmall - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend andshould buyor lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.How's everything on your front.

Last week I went to see Canadian Steamship Lines. Prior to my visit I asked Vikas, the middle marketing associate, to contact Singapore and get quarterly offers for IFO 180. Vikas emailed Hans Wong three times.  He also called twice. I also asked  Sarah Mulholland to call Singapore on Friday prior to start of my meeting. She could not reach Hans either in the office or on his cell phone. We finally received some numbers Monday morning, obviously too late for our client meeting.I understand that you have been working very hard to increase responsiveness and market development for crude and products.  With this in mind, I  believe have a partial solution  that will prove beneficial to all. On the EGM fundamentals page I intend to include a section where the mids of all products will be posted based on the day's close. I think this would help everyone stay on top of the various markets and products around the world.Thanks for your attention to this matter.Jen---------------------- Forwarded by Jennifer Fraser/HOU/ECT on 10/17/2000 12:45 PM ---------------------------Vikas Dwivedi <bmfvikas@yahoo.com> on 10/17/2000 12:22:42 PMTo: jennifer.fraser@enron.comcc:  Subject: F180 QuotesJennifer,These are the quotes we got Monday morning.--- Hans.Wong@enron.com wrote:> From: Hans.Wong@enron.com> Subject: Re: bill.berkeland@enron.com> To: bmfvikas@yahoo.com> Date: Mon, 16 Oct 2000 11:36:41 +0800>>> q1/q2 2001 5.5/mt-7/mt   q3/q4 2001 3/mt -4.5/mt>__________________________________________________Do You Yahoo!?Yahoo!

December 2000 was thethird highest-rated month ever. The Blizzard of '96 gave TWC its highestratings, followed by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999. Among the many recording-breaking weather events reported by TWC last monthwere the snowiest weather ever in at least 12 cities and the coldest weatheron record in many places, including Louisville, Ky.December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather inOctober and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarterrating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due toquieter than usual hurricane activity.TWC's coverage of the year-end Nor'easter that blanketed New York City withover a foot of snow achieved a 0.870 rating, delivering 679,000 householdsacross the country on Saturday, December 30 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.).  The topquarter hour occurred at 10 a.m. with a rating of 2.279 reaching 1.8 millionhouseholds.  The weekend rating for Dec. 30-31 was 0.753,  representing overa half million households tuned in at any given time, according to Nielsendata.  This was the second highest-rated weekend in 2000 and the sixthhighest-rated weekend in TWC's history.Consumers also turned to weather.com in record numbers. By the close ofDecember, weather.com delivered more than 429 million total page views,which is 67 percent higher than the previous monthly record, and 232 percenthigher than December 1999.  At its peak, weather.com delivered a record 27.8million page views in a single day.  More than 1.3 million Unique Visitorsfrequented weather.com  per day during the two weeks prior to Christmas,according to Media Metrix.The average TWC rating (6 a.m.-6 a.m.) from Dec.16-31 was 0.598, deliveringan average of 464,000 households, according to Nielsen.

I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have also purchased an Appel in the last month.I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.  At least that is what I am thinking now.Bonnard (colorful only)LautrecSuerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any)Other impressionist or post impressionist lithosBraqueMooreArpRouaultModrianRothkoKlineMotherwellBy the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a ""push wa"" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one.

Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  Enron Freight MarketsDuring its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.EnronOnlineOn May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. EnronOnline StatisticsBelow are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001?Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million?Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion IN THE NEWSEnron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity.

There were several issues and concerns which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal application capability (that is the ""net"", understated version).Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, BMC could do to ""fix their problem"".  I relayed the gist of our brief conversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.

The responses were:1.Stock price2.The PRC3.Employee/internal morale4.External reputation and image5.""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect_________________________________________________________________________________________II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.% of employees respondingstrongly agree/agree:I am committed to staying at Enron.64.1%Enron is a company I would invest my money in.60.1%I am treated with respect.60.0%I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.59.1%I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.54.7%Enron truly encourages people to take risks.47.5%My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.46.6%Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.41.6%_________________________________________________________________________________________III.

Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.1.People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):---talented---creative---     learn from one another2.Culture and reputation:---innovative spirit---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks---   ability to embrace change---   involvement in community3.Work environment:---pay and benefits---   true meritocracy---   unlimited opportunities_________________________________________________________________________________________The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.STOCK PRICEWe are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:---A decline in the overall market and economy;---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.---Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.---We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:---Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.THE PRCThe relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:---Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.EMPLOYEE MORALEWe believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.---We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.---We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.---Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.EXTERNAL REPUTATIONWe all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:---We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.INTEGRITY & RESPECTI believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.---Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.---We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.",

He made several comments of interest:Enron's Position on Market StructureDan says he's heard from the Enron traders that they like ""PJM.""  Dan would like us to have one of our traders come up to Washington to meet with his staff to talk about what attributes of PJM we really like.  For example:   - what brings liquidity - what benefits does liquidity bring -- to both Enron and utilities with end use customers -- how does    liquidity benefit consumers? - why do we support PJM over New York and New England - what facilitates trades, reduces transaction costs, gives the right signals to generators of where to site Gas Pipeline IssuesDan also talked about his concerns with affiliate issues on the gas side.  He said INGAA has not been particularly helpful in the debate -- they disagree that changes are needed and do not provide much to the discussion.  Dan said he prefers structural changes over Code of Conduct fixes -- he doesn't want to have to look under rocks for violators.  He also questioned whether, if pipeline executives' compensation is based on the company's profits (through options and salary) which are derived in part from trading, whether this provides those executives with incentives to favor their affiliates.  Regulatory GapDan is concerned that there is a regulatory gap between FERC, the CFTC and the SEC.  He believes there is a large block of transactions -- primarily bookout transactions -- that are not being regulated by FERC or the CFTC.  We discussed that there is a physical component to bookouts, but he is still concerned that no one is overseeing these transactions.He also compared FERC to the SEC and said they do not have the expertise or staff to provide market monitoring the way the SEC does.  I think FERC has been compared to the SEC recently and Dan's comments may have been somewhat defensive in response to those comparisons.Open AccessDan is a supporter of open access and hopes that the new Commission make up will lead the Commission to addressing and fixing the structural problems in the industry.  They have been frustrated by the amount of time and attention California has taken, and he is hopeful that they will be able to get California behind them and focus on transmission issues.  He believes FERC needs to have jurisdiction over native load and intimated that he would not be unhappy if FERC lost the Supreme Court case.EPSA Dan said EPSA needs to be more focused.  We need to decide what issues are most important to the group and focus on those issues.  He also expressed concern that EPSA is always negative and does not give FERC enough credit for the progress it has made.  He also said EPSA needs to get the word out on the Hill that FERC's actions, right or wrong, are having the desired result (lower prices).Overall, it was a good meeting.  Dan was happy to meet with us and said he and his office would like to hear from us about issues whenever we would like to visit with them.Please let me know if you have any questions or comments concerning the foregoing.Sarah",

Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the ""energy crisis,"" an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.",

I hope that I have given you most of the informationyou need to understand our concept and to be able to discuss it with yourcolleagues. We agreed that on my return to the UK I would set out how Enronmight be involved at this stage and be one of the first US firms to pioneerthe idea and become a GoodCorporation network member able to display theGoodCorporation trademark and start conversing with other members. Thosemembers could be private companies, public sector entities or governmentdepartments, trade associations, NGOs etc.As we discussed the GoodCorporation Charter and processes are nearcompletion . We are in the process of starting our pilot verifications whichwill be done by PwC, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Intertek, SGS and BureauVeritas.We are also setting up an Accreditation Body ( which is beingmodelled on the Forestry Stewardship Council)  to oversee the annualverification process. The pilot programme provides companies with an excellent opportunity to havea low risk way of trying out the process and seeing if it works in theirorganisation. They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation.Pilot companies pay for the verifiers' time only and the verifiers aregiving their time at cost ($750/ day.) The pilot itself will take the formof a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the companythrough the evidence (policies and procedures) that need to be in place inorder to pass the GoodCorporation charter. The meeting will decide who needsto be interviewed, in which locations and therefore the number of daysinvolved. As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they areimplemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact, thenumber of days involved should be relatively limited.  During the actualverification, the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewingdocumentation provided by the company, in addition to a series of meetingswith the relevant people, such as the HR Director, Environmental Manager,Finance Directors and customer-facing staff. Assuming it is successful, thepiloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if theyso choose. It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting. Given yourcurrent policies and ethics I wouild be surprised if the charter posed anyreal problem for you . It could also be a useful supply chain tool for youto encourage your suppliers not only to say they behave in the manner youwish them to behave but also demonstrate this behaviour to you and theoutside world in a transparent fashion. Please get back to me if you requireany further clarification and of course I and my colleagues would bedelighted to meet whoever else you need to get involved before a decision ismade.Again, many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you wereenthusiastic about our concept.With very best regardsVicky PryceChairman, GoodCorporation",

It=0F's just another fascinating week in Burrito land.I spent the better part of this week learning something new, which at myage is not easy.  In fact, just about everything at my age is gettingmore difficult.  But I wont  bore you with the details.  The new thing Ilearned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for thisyear=0F's California Governor=0F's Quality Education and Development Award(CalQED).  Its an annual shindig for companies, health careinstitutions, and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the Gov=0F'shand, and hearing that your (pick one: company, non-profit, school,health care institution) are world class.  Being an examiner of thewritten applications, and working with a team of peer examiners is allpro bono on my part.  I am wondering what the hell I got myself into.I=0F'll tell you more about it some other time.Speaking of world class, I got two top notch letters this week that Iwant to share with you.  One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketingand Trading, regarding the May 25 overscheduling on the Silver Peakintertie by 2900 MW (see Lori Eckman=0F's note to me in last week=0F'sBurrito), and a reply to Ken=0F's letter from George Sladoje, CEO of thePX.Ken, who I have known for several years, is a person who doesn=0F't speakout unless something really bothers him. Ken wrote:=0F""Since Day 1, I've always wondered what mechanism was in place toprotect against this scenario [overscheduling on an intertie], or ifthis scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or""feature"".  I always figured it was a feature, simply because I didn'tthink that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked.  Ialso figured that this feature was available for use by marketparticipants and that if it became overused, that it would eventuallycome under scrutiny by the market compliance police.  I also wondered ifpeople could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improvetheir overall positions.  I also figured that for the most part there isno such thing as ""artificially"" high prices since  in my opinion themarket design itself is somewhat artificial.   But now I know thetruth..it's a flaw, it was overlooked and there is noprotection...amazing.=0F""I certainly do not agree with [George] Sladoje's interpretation of thePX tariff (that overscheduling across a path constitutes improperimplementation of a generator schedule, which therefore constitutes aviolation of the tariff).   Also I believe that it is completelyinappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to reston the shoulders of the market participants (i.e. if someone types in anincorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application, the market should notblowup) .  The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies withthe market operator (PX) itself.  PX software should validate that theproper mechanics have been used by the market participants.=0F""By the way, it wasn't us who caused this situation, and of course wewould prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high, but if wereview this situation and retroactively recreate prices, then perhapsall other cases in which congestion at tie-points caused high pricesshould also be reviewed to see if they are ""real"".=0F""By the way, typically, I would not respond to this sort of thing due totime constraints, however, some of our recent involvement in otherISO/PXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and otherISO/PXs.  Each of them, including California, has its strengths andweaknesses, however, it's in California where the unusual is the norm.=0F""I sent Ken=0F's letter to George, and his staff at the PX, and George wroteback the following:=0F""Because the incident of May 25 is the subject of an officialinvestigation by the PX Compliance unit, I cannot comment on thespecifics of this matter at this time.  It is likely that the CalPXMarket Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation andthe results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors.As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace--- we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that theISO do the same.=0F""I disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision 3.3.2 doesnot apply here.  In all major exchange operations the institution notonly provides a forum for trading, but also monitors the activities ofits members, both currently and after the fact.  The participants areexpected to follow the rules.  At one of my previous employers, as anexample, (the Chicago Board of Trade), a suspected abuse or a compliantfrom another member or customer results in an investigation by theOffice of Investigations and Audits (the counterpart of CalPX=0F'sCompliance unit).  Depending on the nature of the issue, theinvestigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee,Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee.  Thesebodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and ifthe issue requires Board of Director action.=0F""Similarly, the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actionsagainst participants who violate tariff provisions.  Our recently filedsanction=0F's protocol formalizes the process further and describes aseries of penalties which can be imposed.  Therefore, we believe ourtariff does provide adequate protection.=0F""Finally, as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past ---this will be part of the investigation process and a review of marketdesign.  Obviously, impact schedule submissions above ATC limits havehappened as a result of free and open markets.  Congestion has become analmost regular occurrence.  The real issues under investigation in thisincident are magnitude, intent and materiality of impact on ourmarketplace.=0F""Thank you, both Ken and George for those comments.  I am sure we willhear from other members on the issue.  Lori, don=0F't be silent.  Youstarted this thing.=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D==3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DSpeaking of market design (segues, I am very big on segues this week),old warrior, dear friend,  and defender of the just, Carl Imparato had afew things to say about the ISO=0F's proposed utilization of ex post GMMs.Carl wrote:=0F""Yesterday, [the ISO Market Analysis Unit] stated that not implementingafter-the-fact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of theCalifornia market structure.=0F""Ex post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure.  When I was atPG&E and we were developing the tariff in early 1997, no one (not atPG&E, SCE or any other market participant, to my knowledge) everadvocated ex post GMMs, and they were NOT included in the tariff.   Idon't recall the words ""state estimator"" (for calculation such GMMs)ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting.=0F""It was only somewhere in mid-1997, when Alex was working on UFEequations, that Alex (I believe) suddenly came up with the proposal forex post GMMs, and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly (before ithad ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum), and was adopted by theISO Board (or whatever group passed for the Board at that time).Immediately thereafter, virtually everyone in SCUG .  We were ignored.=0F""But even in early 1998, we informally agreed that, in light of thefacts (that after-the-fact GMMs were not part of the original ""deal""),after-the-fact GMM implementation would be given low priority and wewould be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO movedforward.=0F""I remember those discussions, Carl.  I wonder if deals made in 1998 haveany meaning today?=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DThe SCE Pilot Forwards Program, a continuing saga for WPTF,  popped upagain this week.  I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday toencourage him to stay the course, and support the ALJ=0F's preliminarydecision to reject SCE=0F's Application, and cancel the hearings on legaland procedural grounds.  Dick said that he supported that notion, but hecouldn=0F't guarantee that all his colleagues would.Alas, two days later, Commissioner Joe Neeper, who clearly had too muchtime on his hands this week, issued a public statement which is long,but here is a taste:=0F""ALJ Hale=0F's Proposed Decision (PD) is structured so that a ""Yes"" votewill terminate the proceeding and a ""No"" vote will continue theproceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution.=01;=01; I have concerns wit=hthe PD.=01; However, I do not intend to issue an alternate because, shouldmy concerns not be addressed, I have the option to vote ""No"" which wouldhave the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written....=0F""If we vote to allow this application to move to hearings, we can laterdetermine whether the Application should be approved on overall policygrounds.  The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does notcomply with what is known as the buy/sell requirement for utilities tosell all of their generation into, and purchase all of their energyneeds for their bundled customers out of, the PX.=01; I agree with the ALJand the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must becompatible with the buy-sell requirement in order to be approved, andthat this threshold decision is therefore necessary.....=0F""The PD concludes that the Application makes SCE=0F's customers morevulnerable to market power abuse.=01;In viewing the comments of parties, Ifind the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best byWestern Power Trading Forum (WPTF) in its opening brief.=01; WPTF states onpage 7 that, under SCE=0F's proposal, ""ESPs will no longer be able tocompete with utilities on the basis of short-run incremental costs in anopen setting"" as envisioned by the PPD.=01;Thus, ""ESPs would find itincreasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which wasneither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retailmarket in which ESPs must participate.""  ... The PX price is determinedin an open setting, and would continue to be determined in an opensetting under SCE=0F's proposal....I cannot find that the proposal wouldviolate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power.  Marketpower concerns should be considered, and weighed against consumer andother interests.=01; These issues certainly can be explored in greaterdepth as policy matters in hearings.=0F""I do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of theCommission=0F's Preferred Policy Decision.=01; The merits of the Applicatio=nshould be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by theCommissioners. =0F""Well, Mr Neeper, justice isn=0F't free.  A hearing is expensive, and whatyour are doing is raising the ante of staying in thegame,unnecessarily.  That supports the incumbents (UDCs), and hurts us.At the time I am writing this Burrito, I do not know if the Commissiontook action on this matter today, or punted it to the July 8 meeting.I=0F'll keep you posted, next week.=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DI am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out lastweek.  First, Dynegy and Illinova are merging, and, second, NEV is beingpurchased by AES.  Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF.  Iwas going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF, but now Ithink I=0F'll take that off my =0F""to do=0F""list.In the NEV deal, the AES Corporation announced that it  has entered intoa definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures  in a transactionvalued at approximately $90 million. AES will acquire all of theoutstanding shares of New  Energy Ventures from its current owners,UniSource Energy Corporation. and New Energy Holdings, L.L.C. (which isowned by senior  management of New Energy Ventures).This is an incredible coincidence.  I was just telling someone, I thinkit was Dan Douglass, that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Dayof NEV, who is a big fan of the Burrito, and quite possibly, although Iam not certain, one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation.Well, heck, she has been at NEV from the beginning, so she deserves allthe financial success in the world, and we wish her well.   I just wantto share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF, a tax-exempt,non-profit corporation, Tax ID 94-3296987, right here in the State ofCalifornia, soon to be a CalQED award winner, is looking for donors forthe soon-to-be-announced Executive Director=0F's fund.  Some of you mightnot know about this new [slush] fund. It is intended to provide all thenecessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wowsattended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invademy private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting, and who want todiscuss high level stuff all through the night.  What=0F's an executivedirector to do?  So, Nancy, I was just thinking, we could launch thisprogram in your honor, with your name all over the thing, and get thisvery important and much needed program in place.  At least it will payfor a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during thesemeetings on my hotel-room couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him.By the way, if, God forbid, the deal falls through, then forget I wroteall this.Have a great weekend.

""There's nothing out of (the) ordinary planned for the rest of the business,"" said company spokeswoman Karen Denne. ""We are continuing to hire in the businesses most rapidly growing."" Those growing businesses include Enron Wholesale Services, she said. Earlier Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported the company would cut between 5% to 10% of its European staff, or as many as 500 workers. This past summer, the energy company announced staff reductions at its Enron Broadband Services division. The number of employees affected by this decision wasn't immediately available, Ms. Denne said. Before Thursday's announcement, the company's shares were trading lower on the New York Stock Exchange. But in afternoon trading today, shares of Enron (ENE) were up $1.11, or 3.3% to $34.60. With these latest gains, the stock is now up about 40% from the three-year low of $24.46 set a week ago. For several months, Enron shares have been under pressure as investors struggled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments, including declining energy prices, the recent and sudden departure of its chief executive, disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its Indian power plant project. The stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargains or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of some overseas assets. On Wednesday, Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to BG Group PLC (BRG), a United Kingdom oil and gas company. J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said the stock also received further support by the reaffirmation of earnings forecasts at rivals Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) in recent days. - Write to Christina Cheddar at christina.cheddar@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron Seeks To Cut Staff In Europe By 5%-10%10/04/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday. ""We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance,"" Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires.The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E.U. The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses. Enron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continually giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets. ""Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,"" Sherriff said. ""It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings,"" he added. While trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in other products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron's pure trading strategy. Enron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999. As such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany. However, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy. -By Geoffrey T.

Acquisition Speeds Select Energy's Northeast Growth-ExecBy Kristen McNamaraOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/04/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Select Energy Inc.'s planned purchase of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing Inc. will speed up by a year or two the company's plans to expand its business beyond New England to the entire Northeast, Select's president said. The acquisition stengthens Select Energy's position in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, boosting its efforts to become a regional leader in the business of managing energy supply for industrial and commercial customers and trading electricity in the region.""We want to be the dominant player here,"" President William Schivley said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. ""By being the dominant player in the Northeast, we'll be considered a national player."" Select, a unit of Berlin, Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities (NU), faces competition from national heavyweights like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy (DUK), AES Corp. (AES) and Exelon Corp. (EXC). Select Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and retail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets. Integration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Mohawk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said. The companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination. Select Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open. The company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is expected in late November. Select has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion. Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of $635 million in 2000. Select Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said. ""This is more than just window shopping,"" Schivley said. ""We are actively seeking out hard assets."" The company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Grid Group PLC (NGG), he added. Within the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likely to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those needs become more complicated, Schivley said. Energy, along with labor and raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said. ""We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds,"" Schivley said. ""We've taken a giant step in New York. All the products we offer will be expanded dramatically and increased to a number that, without the acquisition, would have taken us a year or two to get to."" -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO MandateBy Bryan Lee10/04/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of ""what it does for local reliability."" DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits. ""We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest,"" the Public Power Council testified. ""Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good."" ""Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest,"" declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities. ""The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small,"" said a group of aluminum producers. Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast. 'RTO Week' FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during ""RTO Week"" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate. ""I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now,"" Wood said at an ""energy community"" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va. Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting. The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings. Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits. During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators. Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as ""economically dangerous."" Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC. The state regulators want ""an opportunity to be at the table,"" McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted. FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was ""blindsided"" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate. Later in the day, Wood told reporters that ""RTO Week"" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators. At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition. ""This process needs to be goosed,"" said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders ""an external catalyst"" to get the process moving. ""If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that,"" he said. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: NewPower signs up 50,000 new electric users in Texas.10/04/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The New Power Co. said Thursday the electricity grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50,000 residential customers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for processing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retail electric service providers during the state's deregulation pilot program, NewPower said in a statement.The switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months before consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail electricity provider. New Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided to switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL&P and TXU Corp. markets. The New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. , is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States. The Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was delayed two months due to computer problems. The entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan. 1, 2002. A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas told Reuters previously that about 120,000 residential customers had signed up for the pilot program.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. States protest federal involvement in electricity competition, deregulationBy H. JOSEF HEBERTAssociated Press Writer10/04/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation. But one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids.During the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation's power grids and the future of electricity competition. At one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power, was being ""whipsawed"" from both directions. The commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets. But utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales, usurping a traditional state function. At the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition. In June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators. ""It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds,"" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told the justices at Wednesday's hearing. The other states party to the lawsuit are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermont and Wyoming. Malone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates. ""This case isn't about rates,"" countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Power Marketing Inc. before the court. ""What we're concerned about is getting onto the (grid) system."" Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still ""hog"" the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region. The Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states. Edwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his view, could have gone further, as Enron has argued. But, he said, to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission, something it chose to leave to the states. The case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California. About half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition. Many power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not nationally. And that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission. In an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid. A court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort. Uncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts. --- On the Net: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/ Enron: http://www.enron.com/corp/Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Comments are appreciated. A few people met with FERC last Friday to discuss our general observations and what a good RTO will look like (please see attached file below).Not all RTOs intend to file on October 15.  The filing RTOs (from what I can tell) include the following: (1) RTO West, (2) Desert Star, (3) SPP, (4) Entergy, (5) Southern Transco, (6) Grid South, and (7) Florida RTO.  (SPP and Entergy may file together)1. Immediate Public ResponseIt is critical to make sure that we have a list of key issues with each RTO filing that we can use to make public statements.  Each RTO lead should prepare  preliminary list of issues and send to Joe Hartsoe and me no later than Friday.  When the RTO filing is made, we need to review this list and compare to the actual filings and finalize.  This information will go into building our public message.  Our initial response will be public (through the trade press).  This will include making specific comments about each RTO.Right now we are focusing on (1) failed efforts and (2) insufficient work as the key problems.  Any details or other topics should be considered.2. Formal Response to October 15 FilingDan Watkiss of B&P will be reviewing the formal filings for details.  Joe Hartsoe will coordinate our FERC filings due on November 15.  We need these done by early November to run them through the commercial side.  Each RTO lead should schedule some time in DC the week of Oct 24 with Joe Hartsoe to make sure that our filings are on-track and complete.We should file in each RTO case.3. E-trans ResponseJeff Brown continues to work to build our model.  No formal plan to roll this out has been yet developed.  We are working to have something ready by December 1.4. Northeast Tight Pool ResponseI would like Steve Montovano to take the lead to structure our response.  We heard at FERC that PJM was considering filing pretty soon (next week).  We need to get our story straight to take this to a pre-filing meeting at FERC.",

These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years:Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests.While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints.The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures.Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports.RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology.Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services.  DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an ""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs.TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO.Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest.  Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit."")Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity.Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance.  Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, there is evidence of discriminatory instances.Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs.There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies.In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE (including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information.The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication are needed.The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information.Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a ""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine competition.The reports are attached below. - southeast.pdf - midwest.pdf",

Dennis has a meeting lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read ""financed by"") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third parties (read ""Enron""?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas load.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' argument is going to be:  ""I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you.""  ""You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or escalate, you lose.""    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick PNM in the shins.""  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on this.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even more publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor out there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.   I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together to give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the project if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be interested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me after the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF    ",

Weather a little cooler for this week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  Leads to more upside potential in short term.  My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.   i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside.  Thoughts?",

No agreements have been reached because there are none that are contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the GOI for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the other memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I finished sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different than what we have been following all along and I believe that  you know that already.  If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this with you or if u want to follow a different strategy then please let me know. I am at the Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge immediately and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I agree that this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are moving, I think that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately over the weekend so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and start transitioning the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the team in delhi as soon as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have urgent commitments in Mumbai that require my presence there.As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential for you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and developing the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the train and if we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down and assist them in any way we can. regards,SanjayRebecca McDonald11/30/2000 01:13 PMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: James A Hughes/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob Walls/NA/Enron@Enron, Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jeff Skilling@ENRON, Kenneth Lay@ENRON Subject: Meetings with Sharad PawarSanjay,Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it is cooperation and coordination is paramount.Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any agreements that were agreed to.

It was my understanding that I would receive some response from the company within a week or so after our meeting.  Gwen has updated me as to the reasons for the response delay due to key executives being on vacation, but regardless I was led to believe I would have heard some response around May 24th.  I am getting concerned and would like to know the company's position.In addition, the Performance Review Process has begun for my group and is to conclude by June 14th.  I have spoken to Gwen as to my concerns as to whether I should participate in this review process.  Although I did not select them to review me, both Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro have informed by boss, Joe Hillings, or their intentions to review me.  Given the concerns raised by me about them during our meeting and concerns expressed to others about them on previous occasions,  I have grave reservations as to their ability to provide an objective review of my performance.I welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further.

Can you give me idea as to when the House and Senate mark-ups of the electricity bill take place?  I am trying to determine the timeframe in which you want to respond to Steve.   From:  Cynthia Sandherr                           06/22/2000 05:51 PMTo: Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Gwendolyn Petteway/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jocelyne@pdi-corp.com Subject: Career AdvancementDear Cindy: It occurred to me that I should share some addition thoughts and concerns with you regarding my situation. First and foremost, as I tried to make clear during our recent meeting with Steve Kean, it is my desire to stay with the company.  I have invested over 10 years with Enron and feel that I have made substantial contributions to its success.  However, I continue to be frustrated over the fact that I have been demoted and that  there has been no response to or acknowledgement of my application for Joe Hillings' position.  If I am, in fact , not going to be considered for the position, I believe I am owed the courtesy of knowing that. I would also argue that I have made significant progress in addressing the ""communication issues"" that have of recent concern to Steve.  I have had a number of productive sessions with Jocelyne Gessner, Ph.D. of Personnel Decisions International on successful executive relations and management, and she informs me that, in her view, my ""deficiencies"" as perceived by Steve in that area may have been overstated.  Dr. Gessner has made numerous attempts to call Steve to discuss my progress in a tripartite conversation and he has not been responsive.  While I recognize that Steve is extremely busy, it seems to me that if he, as he stated during our meeting, really wants me to stay with the company, he would make it a point to determine if the issues of his concern were being addressed.  If he is not interested in garnering feedback about my sessions, one could reasonably conclude that the perceived ""communications problem"" is merely a pretext. It also continues to concern me that the restructuring of the Washington office has been done without any written changes to my job description.  Many people within Enron with whom I have had a long-standing relationship continue to ask me for lobbying assistance on various issues because they have been satisfied with the results that I have obtained for them in the past.  Because some of those issues are now not my primary or secondary area of responsibility,  per the new organizational chart, I have been compelled to refer those inquiries and requests to others.  In doing so, I fear that this could create a misperception that I am unwilling to provide customer service to others in the company.  I am sure that you would agree this could, in the long run, hurt my chances for increased compensation and advancement. The present legislative activity on a number of high-profile Enron legislative issues, including the company's top priority of electricity restructuring, has precluded me from formally responding to Steve's separation offer.  While I recognize that it was made in good faith and that it provides a basis for further discussions, I would like to respond after the House and Senate mark-ups of the electricity bill take place. In the meantime, I would welcome any guidance or suggestions that you might have, and I greatly appreciate your interest in my situation.

We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.Thanks,Renee -----Original Message-----From: Allen, Phillip K.  Sent:Thursday, November 01, 2001 8:26 AMTo:Ratcliff, ReneeSubject:Renee,Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.Thank you,Phillip Allen",

It is not my desire foryou to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your listthat I need furtherclarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that thiswas applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cashinvestment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cashinvestment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on theclosing statement or on some other document.Phillip",

There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and password is jackd.

Until we know something more, it is a difficult question to answer.However, in answer to your questions:1.You cannot transfer an L1 visa to another company, as it is Enron specific.2.You can stay in the US for a short time to pack up and move things.   You cannot stay indefintely, as you will be out of status.3.If your wife gets a working visa, then she will be able to stay legally, but I imagine you would then be her dependent.4.Alternatively, you can look for a job and get an HIB visa for yourself and and H4 visa for your wife (she still cannot work on an H4 visa).
